Okay. Good afternoon ma'am.
Speaker 2
Good afternoon.
Speaker 1
My name is senimatu. I'm a 500 level physiotherapist student and I'm working on a project topic titled , exploring physiotherapists perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adults. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older and from the perspectives of Nigeria physiotherapists. Okay. So, um, I'll asking you some questions. Um, can you then define mobility?
Speaker 2
Mobility is the ability to know from one point to another. Okay. And it could be moving from bed to chair, from chair to bed or moving from one location to another location.
Speaker 1
Okay. How you define culture?
Speaker 2
Culture is um, the way and manner people, a group of persons. Yeah. Actually live their life or their belief. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. And do you think culture influences mobility?
Speaker 2
Yes, I think it does, especially for older people as they age. Okay.
Speaker 1
Just for like in what way do you think this culture influence them?
Speaker 2
Okay. From my experience and interaction with older persons. Okay. Um, um, it's culturally recommended for us to do things for older persons. Okay. We see it as a way of caring for them. We see that um, older persons are not expected to stress themselves in quotes. Thereby they need to move from the bedroom to um, the kitchen. No, we take the food to them. Instead they're supposed to go to the market. No, we go and buy the food and bring for them. You know, we do everything for them out of respect. Yes. For culture we feel that they are paid their dues in their youth and it's now time for us to take care of them. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds?
Speaker 2
Oh yes. Uh, I've worked in different places. I've worked in the north. Okay. So I've seen some of the fulani's culture where the woman is protected. Now this one is even for only older person. Okay. Um, the women are protected and are kept at home at and while you go to the marketplace, you find mostly men in the marketplace because they will go and do all the shopping for the women and bring home there by limiting their mobility outside the house. Now they might be free within the house. Yes. But they do not really go outside the house as such then coming to um, A do. Yes. Now culturally too, we found out that um, there's a lot of respect for culture in this place. Okay. Whereby, you know, at some certain age you feel that you must give them some form of due or no. But preventing them from doing a few things in the sense that we feel that we are actually rendering help for them. Okay. So even if their children are not nearby Yes. People will be community will still do the same person. Okay. Then even when they are hospital um, bound, they're in the hospital, it goes so bad that somebody who is ill or has an acute illness in the hospital but still has good function of the upper limbs will be spoonfed because if you are taking care of the person. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Okay. Um,
Speaker 2
Well of course I've been practicing and been in for about 17 years now. So I've only just used that. My experience here and also my experience having been in geriatrics units for years, one of the things that we do is to educate the caregivers. Okay. We do a lot of education with the caregivers to let them know that yes we know that there are some things that are culturally acceptable, yes. But they're limiting the mobility of these persons so that they will be able to understand where we are coming from. And um, we also do what we call family uh, meeting because it's not only the caregiver we see today that will be educated, we try to educate beyond the family members. So that's where we assess the patients who we've been told his um, has been immobile and only uses maybe working frame, you know, within the house. Yes. And after assessing the patient's muscle power, we feel the patient can do better. Yes. If we don't educate the family they will go back home and continue what they were used to. So I believe health education is one of the ways that we really um, worked on that.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you ensure that your mobility enhancements are shared this are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client?
Speaker 2
Well, as a physiotherapist, I look beyond capture for my mobility. Okay. Because um, I'm function focused in my practice. So if culture is going to interfere with the function of the patients Yeah. Then you have to build the function first. Okay. And not culture first, but um, there are now some people that you most co whether you like it or most respect their culture because we've had um, circumstances where the  oba's wife Yes. Has presented as patients. Okay. So we must respect their culture and prescribed mobility for them based on the limitation of their culture of that culture. So if the culture says they're not supposed to go out within a certain time, yes. Then we must give them prescriptions that can keep them active and functional within that space that there are
Speaker 3
Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client cultural belief of practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. Like I said, I gave example of the oba's wife earlier on. Yes, yes. And though the OBA's wife is Late, she was the wife of the previous oba, not his present one. Okay. And then she had a lot of issues. So one of the things is that only a female could attend to her. Okay. Another thing was that while she was on, even on the ward, she was secluded from everybody and the same is what goes on in the house. So we had to ensure that she understood the importance of mobility and that she had people around her who could assist her to ensure that she was still active within us because she wasn't really going out again at that time. But even though she was not going out, she had muscle power enough to and believe with working aid. Okay. The working aid was provided. Yes. That she should still use it you within her means.
Speaker 3
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while you expecting their cultural beliefs of practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. I believe I mentioned that a little bit. Yeah. So we always start our education by letting them know the importance of function. Um, looking at definition of aging, you know, aging is a decline of function function, but this decline can be slowed down by ensuring that we optimize the function of the older persons. And so the important thing is to educate the family. When they understand the role of function and the health of their person. Yes. They generally just come around and they able to help them achieve that function. So if for example, we've seen patients who this is very common where they feed them. Yeah. And you know, the more you feed them one of the basic activities that they do for themselves, A D L is feeding. Yes. And so if you're not going to grade their A D L and they're not feeding themselves, they'll score low on the functional score. So once you educate the family and they now on understand it, you'll see a huge improvements in their ability to perform their Ts. Okay.
Speaker 1
In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adults from different cultural groups
Speaker 2
In this country? I think one, number one that should be considered is um, the cultural factor. Whereby some do not want an opposite sex to come close. Okay. Okay. But it's not possible all the time. 'cause if for example there's only a male physiotherapist, yes it is not possible, but you can have a chaperone. So even if male physical therapist is available, they have the female health assistant, so a female nurse to be a chaperone while you are carrying out the mobility training. Um, apart from that, for those who are not allowed to go out within a certain confine, yeah we can still ensure the mobility within that space and encourage 'em to do as much as they can within their space and not relate to tell you on help.
Speaker 3
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 3
Hmm.
Speaker 2
At different cultural level, this may be a bit difficult see, For instance, like I said, I practice in the north for a short while. Yeah. Bashiga culture will not allow a male to have access to a home to say you want to even do home assessment or check mobility assessment for a patient that is homebound. And at the time I practiced there was only, um, I was only female physiotherapist in the states. Yeah. And, and um, I had to attend to the king to a king who presented and who felt if female can't attend to me, to him. And of course I left the patient and but when the pain became too much, yes I was called back. So after educating them so you can have your cha around so as to allay their fears or having a female to male, I think it made it easier for them to accept intervention.
Speaker 3
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers into in the mobility assessment or intervention process, Particularly when cultural beliefs or practice are involved?
Speaker 2
Okay. I believe I've kind of mentioned this earlier. Yes. Yes. In my practice we always, a caregiver is always involved in the care from the beginning to the end. Because when you turn your back caregiver is always there to implement whatever you have Yes. Actually prescribed. And we also do family meeting, like I said, to get them up to speed the plans we have for the patients. Okay.
Speaker 3
Thank you.
Speaker 1
Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client health of quality of life,
Speaker 2
Cultural,
Speaker 1
Successful mobility
Speaker 2
Okay. I, I don't know if this would be totally cultural, but we had the client or a patient once who, um, had a house that was not, that was his house. So for him he, he didn't see the need to change his house, but the house was not good for his mobility. Okay. And so we involved the wife and the children. Yeah. And the wife thankfully was a retired nurse and then the children and educated them on the need for him to change location even though for him culturally for him, it's like when you're living in your family house, that is his own comfort zone and he didn't want to live there. Okay. And again, the family was able to afford to buy another house entirely. Mm-hmm and the house was remodeled. Yes. As in working with occupational  therapist remodeled to suit him. Yes. By place. Putting ramps, bath chairs and all of those things. And for somebody who had mobile for a while, it became quite mobile after I was able to independently.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
By interacting with people of the cultural of where I stay because uh, majority of the patients that I work with Yeah. Are from Edo origin because ofcourse we are in Edo here. Yes. And so because of that, I'm not from Edo so I have to discuss more are from this area to know their cultural beliefs, their dos, and don't so that I'm guided when I'm working with patients.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh, well I've not worked with any, the interpreter.
Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah  interpreters
Speaker 2
As a not someone  that designated to be cultural interpreter, but like I said, you could have another healthcare worker who understands the culture better. Yes. And so that basically could stand in place. Okay. Of that therefore community practitioners? Yes. Uh, we've had to work with, um, public health nurses. Okay. Who do home visiting to actually as ascertain  that. Um, these patients actually continue with their mobility. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much, ma,  for your time. Do you have any comment recommendations for me?
Speaker 2
No. Thank you. I don't. Well done. Thank you ma.'''},

Okay. And good afternoon, sir. Um, I'm a 500 level physiotherapy student, and I'm working on, on, on the project topic exploring physiotherapy perspective on culture and mobility and among community dwelling older adults and I would like to ask you some questions. So, um, can you tell me what you understand? The word mobility.
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. Thank you for making me a participant in this study.
Speaker 1
You're welcome, sir. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Uh, mobility, mobility has to do with, uh, movement and function. Okay. When you talk about mobility, there is an action performed by someone, which means that there's distance and there's time by function is an act of carrying out a specific, uh, assignment. Okay? Yes.
Speaker 1
Yeah. Can you explain culture in your own words?
Speaker 2
Okay. Culture, culture is a, is a way of life. Simply demands a way of life. Yeah. That, uh, involve, uh, like we have, it involves, uh, religion involves, uh, religion and a normal, a normal way of life. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Uh, do you think that culture influences mobility?
Speaker 2
Yes. Yes. Culture, culture has actually, has, uh, culture actually have effect on, uh, mobility. Yeah, sure. Because, uh, uh, with the years of practice and, uh, the experience I've gathered over the years, you know, when it comes to a certain whereby whereby, for example, maybe you are practicing in the north, northern, uh, state of the, uh, of this country where you have, where they don't joke with their culture and for example, maybe you have to, to assess or treat a, a patient, a female patient that is, uh, putting on an hijab of a thing and, you know, because of their culture, they feel that as far as you are not, uh, this person is not you, you are not married to this person, they feel that, oh, they'll prefer another gender or the same gender of that person to carry the intervention of on the person, which, which means that the effects of culture on the assessment of, of, uh, patient is key over there. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. Very good. I remember, I, I, I remember that during my internship day I needed to attend to a patient. We had a new patient. Uh, a reverence sister came in to the clinic with, uh, uh, with back pain and the neck pain, you know, as a male, I assessed her, but when it got to the point of, uh, inter uh, uh, intervention and co, I will need actually needed her to pull her clothes. But she was like, oh, please, do you have a female person? You know, she actually plead there. Not that she enforces, she only actually plead that that please do we have a female just because of her own belief, because as we all know that they are not married. Yes, they are, they're alive and their life is just to serve God to God. And at that point in time, I to all know and respect, uh, opinion decision and how to get the person, a female, uh, female therapist to attend to her.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessments?
Speaker 2
Okay. When it comes to cultural consideration to my mobility assessments, yes, yes. For example, uh, if you are, lemme just ask because when it comes to cultural, cultural
Speaker 1
Consideration,
Speaker 2
Consideration, yes. When we have to respect our culture, that's the first thing which we know in the case whereby you have a patient that is putting on full hijab, I'm still going to use a a, a Muslim as a Muslim clients as an example. As an example, yes. He have a female patient that is, that puts on full  hijab from top down. And let's assume that this patient had a suffer stroke, which you know, that when they have stroke in the patient, there is weakness of the limb. And in that case, you, it's actually my duty to encourage and educate this patient on the risks of putting on this hijab. Because when there's weakness on one part of the body and the person wants to walk, move very fast. If the patient or the client is not careful, there's tendency of the patient stepping on that long gown, which will for the predispose to fall. And you know that once the patient falls, you also, you know what the solution is there be complication and that will feel like a setback. Yes.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Okay. There's a question again.
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for the client?
Speaker 2
Okay. For all our clients, there's what we call individual assessments. Yes, good. Like I've been, I think I've been citing examples from the north. Yes. But let me, let me come back to the west where we know, uh, with where we take religion in the west is just, we just take it anyhow. Yeah. I must always ensure that the cultural belief and mobility should suit to what will make me to get progress, what will make me to, to focus on the, the patient's improvement. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client's cultural belief practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. Yes. Uh, one, like the cultural, like I said at that time that uh, if you are dealing with a, uh, a Muslim client, yes, yes. You have had a there is a patient that comes to your clinic, this patient's in pain, and your goal is to ensure that this patient gets well. Yes. Yes. And if patient has some belief that, oh, without this, there's a patient that oh, because of that belief, if you're unable to meet up the standard of their belief, they would prefer to go home with the pain. Yes. And what I'm to do in that aspect is that's why when it comes to employment, I am of the opinion that you should have equal gender in terms of employment because when such case arises, you don't need to start. Oh wow, there's no female here. What if there's no female and the person doesn't, the person will go home with pain. The adjustment I'll do is I'll sure that in all the units that we have female to therapist Okay. So that when such case arises, there'll be someone to fit into that. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you educate clients about the, the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural belief practice?
Speaker 2
Oh, very good. We all know that movement is life. Yes. Movement is key. Yes. Sedentary lifestyle is, it's, uh, it's uh, how would I call it? It's like the person's close to death. That's it. I must and I will always encourage my patient. That's irrespective of your cultural belief. Yes. Movement is key. If there's any of your, if you have any item in your belief that is against movement, yes. I will try my possible best. I will try my possible, possible best, best to ensure that no matter what, no matter what is the belief is movement should still be encouraged. Okay. At all time. Okay.
Speaker 1
In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in older adult from, different ethnic or cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Again, please say it again.
Speaker 1
In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in older adult from different ethnic or cultural goods?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh, the, the factor we, I think I'll consider is, uh, one the, the mode of dressing. Okay. Yes. That's because the only thing that, that, uh, that can affect mobility Yes. Is still the mode of dress. Our belief. I don't think our religious belief has a way or, or has any effect on mobility. Mobility. Yes. Because we all know that movement is key. A movement is life. Yes. Is just the mode of dressing, which I feel if the, if my clients put on something like a, a clothing material that will impede or affect mobility Yes. And I know that I want this patient to be fine. Okay. I'll try my possible best to encourage and educate the patient on the possible risk of, of, uh, of, uh, the kind of clothing you put leader or she puts on.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 2
Oh, good. This is beautiful. Yeah. To address this, because this is not an individual, you, you, you cannot say, okay, maybe you only have a client in the clinic and you educate the client and you feel that things have been addressed. There's what we call awareness. Okay. You have to go, you have to move out of your shell. Yes. There should be public awareness mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and this could be carried out through, through, uh, through public system. You can organize like a, an outreach mm-hmm.  Yes. And you can also, uh, go on radio, tell them the possible and tell them the link and tell them the effects on, um, the effect on their daily activities and their health. Okay. In their health. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural beliefs or practices are involved?
Speaker 2
Okay. The how, how,
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural beliefs or practice are involved.
Speaker 2
Okay, very good. Like the practice in my clinic present presently. Okay. Patients, most times they come with their normal caregiver or siblings or their children and everything. At the point of assessment, this is actually part of the goals. Okay. We have in our intervention patients education. Education. Okay. And like I said the other time, patient education involves one, the cause of the ailment, the possible risk factors. Okay. And the possible factors that could cause recurrence of, of, uh, the same condition. And if there's any of them that could be affect by that could be affected by the cultural belief, I will ensure that I educate the caregiver and, uh, everyone links with the patients. Okay.
Speaker 1
Yeah. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client's health of quality of life?
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. The, there, there are, okay. There are, there are some like, uh, I, I'm not going to link this directly to religion because I've had a case whereby, whereby I told a patient in my clinic, the patient was actually supported, uh, by his, uh, caregiver into the clinic. Okay. And after my assessment and intervention, I called this caregiver meeting and I told him, I said, oh, please, mom will need assistive device. Mm-hmm.  specifically, I think I remembered if I could remember, I told them that mom would need quadripod. Okay. And immediately the reaction of the caregiver was like, no, God forbid though, no, my mama my mama not go use anything, waka oh, No, you go wakabecause we not believe in that thing. You know, it was a challenge to me, but I had to, I went for that, to educate them, them the possible risk factor if this support is not provided. Okay. And I let them know that, oh, if for example, you allow mama to walk because this, the, the balance have been assessed and she wasn't there, that if you allow mama to walk with without support,  you know, the risk of fall will be so high and at the end mama will start from zero.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you stay informed about cultural practices and beliefs that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Oh, very good. To stay informed just by, uh,continuous, uh, professional development. Sure. Because you have to be up to date in current practice. You have to be, you have to be in line with the evidence-based practice and this, this can be achieved by reading publications. Check out some articles done online and see what is obtainable in other culture in other countries so that at the end you'll be able to make some recommendation at that, your local level.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professional such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Again, read this again.
Speaker 1
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility interventions are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. The, the, the best way when it comes to, when it comes to other health worker, yes. One, the only thing that link all together is one, patient. Okay, good. But if the patient in the ward is case notes, yes. Good. And the best way to communicate is to, with other healthcare professional. It's true presentation. Okay. After I, after I've done my own research and I want my result to be known by other healthcare professional is what, what I need to do at that point in time is for me to write for a presentation and I'll go there and do some presentation. Okay. And if possible, any findings I've done in my own private, in my own units, yes. I can actually bring it out and share with them so that, uh, they will also imbibe our, our, our key into this assessment and the cultural belief.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it.'''},

Good afternoon.
Speaker 2
I'm a 500l level physiotherapy student and I'm working on a project titled Exploring Physiotherapist perspectives on Culture and Mobility Among Community dwelling Older Adults.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
So, um, I would like to ask you some questions.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
In your own words, can you define mobility?
Speaker 3
Mobility? Mobility Basically from the act of being mobile. Okay. So basically it means um, the ability to move from one point to another
Speaker 2
Can you define culture?
Speaker 1
Culture Is the way of life of a person or a group of people.
Speaker 2
Okay. Do you think culture influences mobility
Speaker 1
Influence mobility? I don't think
Speaker 1
So, I don't think so.
Speaker 2
Why Do you say that?
Speaker 1
Because Everybody moves now. So irrespective of your culture, a benin man moves, a to run a man moves an igarra man moves respective of his culture so,
Speaker 2
Okay. Can  you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Speaker 1
Basically I've been in south, south all through. So most of my clients are always benin people I have, but yeah, also one and the same because maybe what now makes them one and the same is the fact that the area that they stay also, maybe that's the aspect of culture that you might talk about, but most times they don't always, maybe the culture that they have most times they don't always doesn't always count again. So they now involve themselves. They invite themselves more in where they are, where they are determines most things, the treatment and how they factor ensure. Okay.
Speaker 2
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 1
Cultural
Speaker 2
Consideration
Speaker 1
Okay. Basically there are some cultures that might have some influence but culture has not really influenced too much. It doesn't, basically the do is the do is because I'm a yoruba, I don't want you to touch me because I'm this, I don't want to touch me most times all religion, but religion and culture, I believe they're different too. Some religion are deep into the culture, but
Speaker 2
How do you ensure that your mobility enhance enhancements? S are culturally sensitive and appropriate
Speaker 1
Well this one obviously, um, there are some culture that are more conservative,
So, some people that are, that are conservative, like some people do, will not, probably not allow you touch. Yeah, I've had the patient I've had that is only ladies that see them. So in that, in that point, obviously as a physiotherapist your patient can choose okay to say, well I don't want you to see. So at that point we allow the female clients to, to female physios to see the female. Uh, mostly common with hausa people. Okay. They have this cultural.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment for intervention plan to accommodate a client cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 3
I believe this, this example of The hausa is actually a perfect example. Uh, lemme
See much,Not much.
Speaker 2
How Do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while you respecting their cultural belief
Speaker 1
Uh, basically it's the same for everybody except the ones that probably don't just understand you then probably have to just speak their language to them and it's the same for all
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
So in your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adult from Different cultural groups.
Speaker 1
Okay. Ah, no. Just because I believe our cultural factors as what the client heself belief
Speaker 1
You know, pass, I'm yoruba man, anybody can attend to me, anybody can come. Basically it's just about the client itself. Maybe it's because of the way I see each it sha. That's the way I see it doesn't really affect.
Speaker 2
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating mobility program
Speaker 1
 See cultural barriers can probably include language. Okay. Can include language. So clients that probably don't understand your language or probably they don't understand English basically. So you probably have speak to them in their own language or something. Uh, most times that kind of uh, problem, you probably need an interpreter. I would probably tell this person, oh okay, that this is what you to do this. So interpreting will help them to get Exactly.
Speaker 2
Okay. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural belief or practice are involved?
Speaker 1
Okay, let me, lemme give me self a scenario now. Okay, let me just imagine that also patient I was talking about. Okay, so basically you might need to educate the about some things. Like, okay, okay this is what you do, you need to do. Probably the home programs and all those things since the  and their belief in their culture probably will obviously allow their husband because obviously your husband, your husband don't see your nakedness. My husband don't know you from when you de born you. So yeah, I believe if you can explain some of the own programs needed to the husband and if the wife agrees to it. Yeah, I believe you have like
Speaker 2
Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural concentration Ah, and how it impacted
Speaker 1
The client. I am too practical. I'm too, I'm too practical for even So most times even the initial question I've always been asking them Yes, with the practical, because most of your questions are practical. So in that, that sense should just be, um, finding a close, um, finding a close relative that can make sure things go on smoothly and your good. Okay.
Speaker 2
How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Um, you, you, you need to have a a, a basic knowledge of who you are going to meet. That's why sometimes when you, most times not sometimes, sorry. Most times when you clerk your patient you ask to ask for, um, who, where they are from. Okay. That try, that's one of it's actually important. So sometimes people will just think that okay, you're just asking them why are you asking them? Because you need to understand where they're from because so that you're able to like, okay, you if probably you are, if you are from that culture, if you understand something about that culture because most of us, we have some cultural biases about some cultures. So you probably draw your bias towards that culture and you'll be able to determine that, okay, well this is what I believe will be good for you and this is what I believe will be good for you. Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that the mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 3
I believe most times this community, uh, health workers and the cultural interpreters, they know the culture of this person. Especially if you are not from that side. If you're not from that side, I believe. So you need to number one, be professional. Number two, respect each other. You know, say, because probably I'm the physiotherapist here, I'm boss. No, you don't work like that. It's supposed to be a teamwork, it's supposed to be a collaboration. So, and there's no team, there's no eye in a team. So you has to be collaboration, respect your teammates, your team member, and engage them on what you want them to do. It's not like as if you give them all your cards, you don't give them all your cards. Just making sure that the ones that they need to know, they know it.
Speaker 2
Thank you very much for your time, I really appreciate,

Okay, good afternoon. Afternoon. My name is senimatu and I'm a 500 level physiotherapy student. I'm working on the, on the project topic titled to exploring physiotherapists perspectives on cultural and mobility and among community dealing. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the rules of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adults from the perspectives of Nigeria physiotherapist. And I would like to ask you some questions. In your own words, can you define mobility?
Speaker 2
Okay. Mobility, uh, in is defined as, um, moving from one place to another. Okay. Or being able to move from, um, one, um, destination to another and another to achieve our activities of daily living. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you. Can you define culture?
Speaker 2
Culture is is defined as the people's way of life. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. Do you think culture influence mobility?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh, in my own opinion, yes. Um, I don't think it's, it's having influence on mobility influence me. Yeah. Because, um, he, okay, but looking at it, it may actually have, um, a relationship, but I don't think it's going to be a direct relationship. Maybe an in indirect Okay. Could influence mobility. Okay. In the sense that I say so because mm-hmm. Okay. Um, and because it's a way of the way, um, people's way of life. Yes. And it should be some persons Yes. Believe Yeah. That, you know, let's say, because you're talking about older adults in the community. Yes. And you know, they like moving from one place Yes. To another,
Speaker 1
Another,
Speaker 2
Like moving from visiting people from one place to another. Checking up on them Yes. In the community and checking up. Um, these people can even say, okay, let me come visit these people when I'm lonely or when I'm Yes. I'm this. So from that way of course to this explanation, I, I'm beginning to see that there is full-time relationship between, between culture and mobility
Speaker 1
And so
Speaker 2
Especially in the rural areas.
Speaker 1
Rural, there's community dwelling place. Yeah. Community dwelling place. So culture do influenced this mobility
Speaker 2
Yeah. It influenced mobility, it influenced them. Lemme use, um, my grandma for instance. Okay. Um, she in, when I was staying with her in the village, yes. She, she's always, um, inquisitive to go and visit Okay. Other people because she tell me that that is the way they actually do here. That's the way they actually do here. That's culture sometimes  you will go and check up on people. Okay. People check up on you. You come and check up on you, and that anybody that doesn't do that Yes. Is being considered to not being active or being there. So when she came down with diabetes, not being able to go and ask for those people again. Yeah. She now went into depression.
Speaker 1
Depression, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 2
Okay. Working with, um, diverse cultural background. Yes. Okay. Um, the thing is, um, do dually, um, challenge we really have is when maybe personally from my experiences, pain. Pain, okay. Relate to mobility or No, I'm not talking about your experience. Okay. General. Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1
How do you find the experience with working with client's with diverse cultural background
Speaker 2
Is, is it's just if you can be able to understand this cultural background to help, because I came across a patient, let me share one experience. Okay. Um, from the northern part, the way they perceive pain is different from the way we, from the east we perceive pain and they see it as expression of pain is weakness and you know, physiotherapy will do so much with pain. Yes, exactly. You, I noticed that a pain, I mean, I'm thinking your though is subjective. Yeah. You should be rating at least 8 Yes. But you're asking a patient is, are you feeling pain's saying that No pain, no pain, no pain. Why you are seeing that he's in pain because from their place you find out that actually expressing that pain Yes. Makes him weak because from their place, they're meant to hide pain even when you are feeling pain.
Speaker 2
Yes. So that's in terms of pain. Then another experience I have is, uh, um, managing a, a Muslim lady. Okay. In cam, in Camp? Yeah. I think she had a, she had a thigh, um, injury. Okay. And she, that's muscle, um, delay muscle onset. Okay. So I needed to assess that area. Yes. But it was a bit problem because she couldn't participate in captivity and she was, I needed to assess that area so I can actually do cryo and other things. Yes. Wow. By that region, but because of that limitation Yeah. Of where she, she what she was coming from. Okay. We couldn't do that. So bringing in, um, a chaperone  Yes. She was not still comfortable instead, she now Okay. She was a Muslim? Yeah, she was a Muslim. Oh, okay. Yeah, she's a Muslim. Okay. No, she not said, okay, let's bring in a chaperone Yes. I, I suggested that when the chaperone came, she was not still comfortable instead she want me to educate the chaperone  Okay. What to do. Oh, so, so that the person that is not me teaching physio, teaching my work Yes. To understand person in order to do that, to do that. And I, I was not really comfortable with that and that actually limited, limited whatYou're supposed to do,Actually offer her. But the thing is that she's fine with it. Yes. Even though she's, she's going through a lot. Yeah. But she prefer to give than me having access to manager. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Uh,
Speaker 2
Looking at the, looking at looking at it, uh, is like one of the patients I just finishing now. Okay. The best way I, what I did to encourage him is the recommendation of assisted, um, device. Yeah. Yeah. Hope I'm in line with your question. Yeah. Can you come again?
Speaker 1
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Okay. Into my mobility. Yeah. Yes. The thing is because of the cultural, cultural events, and they must have to make, um, make this movement of, you know, mobility Yes. And stuff like that. So the use of encouragement using our assisted device, maybe wheelchair. Okay. Uh, walking aid or things that could make it easy for them to go and meet, um, each other. So that they think like from my, from description, I told you Yes. That from my side they, they always want to do that. So moving them with this there, I'm letting it Yes. Will help them to, to still be part of the this thing. Then another way you can encourage, um, in this is that sometimes because they have been cut off from participating in community activities Yes. Like going to meetings or, or, so I try to encourage them to participate in this meeting as much as possible because it give them that sense of belonging at least.
Speaker 1
Okay. So you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment Of course. By encouraging them? Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2
Yeah, by encouraging them in the use of the use
Speaker 1
Of this assistance devices.
Speaker 2
Okay. So that they can participate for it.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. Um, how do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client?
Speaker 2
Come again
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client?
Speaker 2
Okay. The, the truth is, is actually from the history of what the patient have said. Okay. Yeah. So when you ask them from what they have described, yes. You know, and subsequently maybe when they're coming for their subsequent treatment, yes. You follow up by asking questions. Okay. Uh, how do you feel about what I told you? Do you think it was useful for you? Yeah. You can also ask their caregivers. Okay. To make sure that they're actually doing what you told them and also that what you suggested Yes. Is actually fine.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you, Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client cultural beliefs or practice? Any example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate that particular client's cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
It truths that I have not, I have not actually, um, done any modification.
Speaker 1
Okay. For
Speaker 2
Now, the one I tried to do, yes. The one I try to do, yeah. It didn't naturally work out, so
Speaker 1
Okay. Didn't work out.
Speaker 2
Didn't work out. So for now I've not actually maybe strategize in another one.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. Thank you. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while  respecting their cultural beliefs of practice
Speaker 2
Anyway, the truth is that the most important thing is to, um, I I tell them the importance Yes. Of mobility. Yes. And why is necessary. Okay. Why is necessary like, okay, let me, let me come in this and let me make another example of what actually happened. You know, there is this, um, this um, particular, um, culture. Yeah. They don't like, um, going on  um, um, footwears or assisted device. Okay.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Speaker 2
So, but it's actually necessary for them to do that because if, okay, okay, let me see. Come again. Okay. What happened there is that when they sole is hot.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 2
The thing actually they, the thing actually they made them from making them mobility movement. Yes. But then now me not recommending the need for assisted device devices so that they can actually meet up the, this thing and one of them was bringing up them this, uh, bathroom slippers to help them, especially in those rural areas. Yes. Sharing my experience in the rural area so that they can actually meet up to that.
Speaker 1
Okay, so you just educate them on the importa.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Once you educate them the importance of it. Yes. It's not there for them to now know how they will do it in order to suit their way of life. Yes. And also their belief. Okay. But the most important thing is letting them know Yes. The importance Yes. Of it to their health. How not being mobile can result to legs swelling okay, that's oedema on their foot. Yes. And the person, if you didn't do this, these are the things that will come. The person will not know, okay, this is the right thing for me to do and know how it'll not affect
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 2
Or disrespect their culture or belief.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in older adults from different ethnics or cultural groups? What are the, the cultural factors that addressing Yes. That can be considered addressing. Okay. Dressing Yes.
Speaker 2
Is important to consider.
Speaker 1
Okay. When you say dressing, can you please explain more? Like how do this dressing
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Affect them?
Speaker 2
Um, but some of them, yeah, but let say from the people maybe Muslims that are usually cover, um, wear things that come down Yes.  And it's necessary that that dress must be put on Yes. For them it's part of their culture. Yes. And sometimes that could limit their mobility. Their mobility. Considering age,vbecause we're talking about older
Speaker 1
Adults. Older adults.
Speaker 2
So if the dressing is not okay, is a problem, I also need to consider pain. Okay. Pain into, into consideration in older adult  Okay. Because if there is pain Yes. And the person have not, maybe because of culture or belief or something. Yes. He's not going to help us to actually get the these thing Then another thing that makes this difference is, let me say, um, you know, over there in the western world, they don't usually stay with their older, they don't, um, stay with their older, with older.
Speaker 1
The older ones,
Speaker 2
They take them in the care home. Okay. So for them maybe it's actually not Okay. Okay. So it's it's could also be part of part of it too. Am I missing that? Another one
Speaker 1
You said, you mentioned there, you said, you said their belief dressing, dressing, religion,
Speaker 2
Pain management. Yeah.
Speaker 1
You talk about pain management, you said some, some culture actually like the not, did you see pain as a, as a bad thing? Yes,
Speaker 2
Of course. Expressing pain as
Speaker 1
A bad. Yeah. So those are part of the cultural factors you mentioned. Okay, thank you. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating mobility? Program intervention.
Speaker 2
How to,
Speaker 1
How do you address these cultural barriers that may prevent clients from addressing or participating lit program or intervention?
Speaker 2
The best way is sensitization Is what? Sensitize sensitization. That's sensitizing them. Okay. When I mean sensitization, it's involving encomprizes both, educating them, educating them, empowering them.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
And, and that is it, it's gonna actually gonna help them One, one job. You just need to just to sensitize them, let them be on their norm. Yes. Be an aware and then empower them for both of them that need the basic things that will help them to handle it. Okay. Which will go long with,
Speaker 1
Okay. Um, I mentioned some of these visiting that might help them with their relation things like,
Speaker 2
Um, our assisted devices Okay. Can help our wheelchair. Okay. Our walking aid. Okay.
Speaker 2
Um, then another way that in naturally affect you, that is this way we perceive, um, this thing we, we usually see people usually see people that have, um, that use this working aid Yes. As being let me as being inferior or to others. Others  And that's where most of the time you see this order. People prefer to use umbrella, Uber, a walking stick. Okay. You give them um, a walking stick again. Yes. That will benefit them, but we find out that they're using an umbrella Yes. Umbrella now making it look like they're using this for some Yes or for rain, but indirectly they're actually using it because to support their kids. Yes. We don't want it to look down
Speaker 1
On them and Yes. Because of the stigma
Speaker 2
'cause of this there that stigmatization.
Speaker 1
Yes. Stigmatization. So
Speaker 2
If you, if you properly educate them and tell them need for.
Speaker 1
Okay, so going back to this, um, question three I asked you before, can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan? Okay. To accommodate a client cultural behavior practice.
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. The, the use of um, the the use of, okay. For instance yes. The use of umbrella. Yes. In place of working stick. Yes. It's very common in the older ones. Yes. You see them, you prescribe them, it came from them. Okay. You see them coming win with umbrella. Yes. In order to prevent stigmatization Yes. Or something. So it's also one of the way to modify.
Speaker 1
Okay. So you actually modify instead of giving them this uh, yeah. Working stigma. Yeah. We share or you actually use an umbrella. Umbrella for that particular patients of in place, of, in place of,
Speaker 2
In place of the work so that they don't feel stigmatized so that they can actually feel free to participate. Okay.
Speaker 1
In the, okay. Thank you very much. Um, how do you engage family members or caregivers in, in the mobility assessments for intervention process, particularly when cultural belief or practice are involved?
Speaker 2
Um, we, we had, we had one in geriatrics. Okay. Uh, what they do they call them um, just a, a kind of house meeting. Okay. A kind of house meeting. Trying to let them understand what you actually, you understand their belief and culture. Yes. But because of the importance of this Yes. That this would actually, this is actually needed Yes. For them to do once, once you educate the, the, the family members mm-hmm.  and you sensitize them, tell them they need to do why they need to do what they have to do. Yes. Yeah. And everybody can call and you try to see from their own point of view. Right. Uh, and now know how to modify to help them. It'll go a long way just to call them for family meeting.
Speaker 1
Okay. To explain this, explain to them.
Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. It's very common in the geriatric world.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. Um, can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client's health of quality of life. Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client's health of quality of life.
Speaker 2
Okay. I once have a patient with stroke. Okay. The patient suffer stroke five years ago. Okay. But because of the cultural these thing  they have towards stroke that stroke is from the, is someone that caused it. Okay.
Speaker 1
It's an attack.
Speaker 2
Is an attack and they have that mentality that once you are stroke and you go to the hospital
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 2
And they they took any needle. Yes. That you are a dead person. Okay. So because of that they locked her up. She didn't even want anybody to know about it. So that they were people that have attack will not be happy that they succeeded.
Speaker 1
They
Speaker 2
Succeeded with their attack. So they have to invite me
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 2
Or home to come and be seeing them at home. Yeah. Um, you actually CT scan actually need to be done. Yes. And MRI put they still don't want to come to the hospital because of the mentality Yes. That they have. And then because she's just still one place because of the weakness and everything. Yes. And she need to work. Yes. Those things she needed to work. That was when an came in, you know, trying to start educating her. Educating them on the need for this, the need for go to hospital. Yes. And try to tell them that this thing, you are having this mentality that if you give any injection to patient you're dead or is even from the villages, no, nothing was stroke is all about what caused it and everything. And after some time he accepted with what I was actually then the question asked me, if I start going, people will still see me get my case. They will still know Yes. That I have actually, you know, suffered a stroke. Stroke or something. That was when the use of this assisted aid Yes. Good. And a umma gives
Speaker 1
Friend.
Speaker 2
What we not did is that when we are going from the place where she shine, we transport with a a vehicle. Okay. But I'm getting to their hospital. Yes. I wouldn't like the wheelchair to walk in. Yes. I would like her to use that, that asma. But when she now begins to see the importance of it Yes. That with that thing she can participate in activities in the community. Exactly. And also does not mean that because she needs to it of engaging both hands Yes. To participate. So that was how she started using it. And that actually, and after some time I now said, okay, let's move to um, when we, we have progressed from busy master, now let's move to tripod. Tripod. Okay. She said no, that one would be obvious for people to know this. And that was where we now started. After the education and everything, check stability and everything. I, we went for an umbrella. Okay. Over that. Yes. And currently the patient is doing well.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much. How do you stay informed about cultural belief and practice that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Actually I just internet studying. Okay. Reading articles, maybe population online. Okay. Reading then from project work? Yes. Back then in  school, um, we published one work then and, and attitude and perception of uh, assisted devices. Okay. And was a mobility in the community. Think it was a rural area. Right, right. So that was how I got to know more Yes. About these challenges. So, so that's actually I read a lot Yes. On that. I read articles and so many often. So that was how I tell myself.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as community interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
No, its is seminar. Okay. When we're meeting seminar meetings. Yes. And we'll talk about it then doing research too. Yes. Maybe part of any research we talk about it then doing outreaches too. Yes. From outreaches. Maybe when we go for outreaches or multidisciplinary. Yes. From there sensitizing we talk about it, we discuss you share experiences. Okay. And that's how we talk at.
Speaker 1
Okay. Yeah. Thank you very much. I actually, I really appreciate your time. Do you have any comment, recommendation for me? So
Speaker 2
Anything uh, and actually, um, I want to encourage you for this research, you want to carry out because its culture actually play a whole lot of role Yes. In this mobility, um,mobility, mobility ity in especially in that school that, yes. So I'm looking forward to the result of your work too. Thank 'cause you with it, we can also know how it, it'll help me. So in my practice too. Yes. To also sensitize. Okay. Educate. Yes. And even empower my health, um, professionals too in order to give our client the best. Yeah.

Good afternoon, sir.
Speaker 2
Good afternoon.
Speaker 1
My name is senimatu, I'm a 500 level physiotherapist student. I'm working on a research topic titled exploring physiotherapists perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adult
Speaker 1
Culture and mobility among community older adults, adults. And the purpose of this research is to understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of communities dwelling older  adults from the perspective of Nigerian physiotherapist. So before we start, do you have any question for me
Speaker 2
Actually community dwelling?
Speaker 1
Older adults.
Speaker 2
Older adults?
Speaker 2
Yes. Okay.
Speaker 2
So we are talking about rural communities.
Speaker 2
Yes. Alright.
Speaker 1
Okay. In your own words, can you then define mobility?
Speaker 2
Mobility? Yes.
Speaker 1
Mobility.
Speaker 2
Mobility is basically to the largest and the act of movement, probably moving from one point, being able to move from one point to another.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
And can you define culture?
Speaker 3
Culture is a people's way of life.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Do you think culture influenced mobility?
Speaker 2
I,
Speaker 2
Um,
Speaker 2
In my experience I, I can't really, I can't really say I think it's influences to some extent. Yes. Especially when you're still talking about the elderly. Okay. Yeah. Because with certain ages, some communities actually believe that the mobility status of a certain person will probably be reduced based on their age or maybe yeah. Practically of their, based on their ages.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 3
Challenges or just my experiences?
Speaker 1
Yeah, just your experience. Just
Speaker 2
Okay. Diverse cultural backgrounds. Um,
Speaker 2
Well
Speaker 2
The experiences can be
Speaker 2
Um,
Speaker 2
In terms of different cultural backgrounds. Yes. Well a majority of the experience actually comes down with um, the issue of communication as regards the language. Okay. Then other than that too, since we're talking about culture, diverse culture have different perceptions about things. So,
Speaker 2
Um,
Speaker 2
In terms of experiences, I think I had distinct in where certain cases I was not allowed to see because I'm a man and the patient is a female. So that's even while I was in akwa ibom I had a case like that too. Then also, yes, while in akwa ibom there are certain conditions that they believe that it's because of um, involvement of evil spirits or the Marines and all that too. No matter how you try to engage the patient, they're always believing that there is a higher power influencing whatever is going on
Speaker 2
With the patient. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Into my mobility assessment? Yes. Okay. First of all, how to know the perception of that culture to mobility before we can know how to go about it. Now, initially I said that certain cultures or I don't even think this is a, actually a cultural thing. I think it might even be a Nigerian thing. Okay. Because once we talk about the elderly, we are always talking about um, the problem with their mobility. Yeah. And that is not entirely wrong because with changes with aging Yeah. It's bound to actually affect their mobility. Mobility. Yeah. So to me, I don't even think it's majorly a cultural thing. It's basically a human thing. Okay.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client?
Speaker 2
Culturally sensitive.
Speaker 2
Yes. And appropriate for your client. Hmm. Okay.
Speaker 2
Now this is a bit difficult since I've already said that. I don't really think that the perception to mobility is a culture. I think that is a human thing. Yeah. But in the event that there is a cultural perception to it, I'll first of all understand where the culture is coming from.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 3
And know how to go about it so I don't infringe on the people's culture. Okay.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate your client cultural belief or
Speaker 2
Practice? Any example? I'm trying to think. Um,
Speaker 2
Honestly nothing comes to mind now because
Speaker 2
Um Okay.
Speaker 2
Nah, nothing comes to mind as far as this question is concerned. Maybe if I had more time and I'd probably think of something, but
Speaker 1
Okay Maybe as time goes on. Yeah. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while expecting their cultural beliefs or practice?
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 2
That's a very good question because um, for certain categories of patient that will see the thing that is mobility aids is sort of a death sentence. Okay. Or it makes, it increases the severity of their condition. So mm-hmm.  a way of making them accept these things that will try to make them see the adverse effects of them not using it. Okay. Now since you're talking about, I'm still relating to the other, since I am in geratric unit now we all know that fall  is actually a big problem amongst the elderly and with fall comes a lot of other complications and the most dangerous among them is probably death. So by the time we enumerate the consequences of a fall to this certain patient and how this mobility aids can mitigate the effect of that fall, I think that can make them understand or be much more acceptable to these uh, mobility aids.
Speaker 1
Okay. In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adult form different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Please call me again with the question. In
Speaker 1
Your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adult from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
In different cultural groups?
Speaker 1
Yes. That is when assessing your addressing mobility in other adult, what factor, what cultural factors should, should you consider.
Speaker 2
Okay. I talked about the issue of sex. Yes. There are some cultures that will not allow a male to treat a or a female to treat a female. Yes. Also in some certain cultures there are certain persons that will not allow certain areas of the body to be exposed. Okay. So it's actually a factor to deeply look at. Um, then also in some other cultures there are certain factors like they, they, they sort of look at use of mobility aids in face weakness.
Speaker 1
Their belief,
Speaker 2
Their belief. So especially for somebody that of is of um, is of high regard in the society, let's say tied to achieve for all whatnot. So seeing them using a mobility aid will sort of probably show some level of sight of weakness to them. So the number is not going through, so they'll probably look at it from um, that angle. I think I've, I think remembering managing a, a justice, what they normally do for this justice that they actual way into his chambers before every other person enters into the court. Okay. Which is not the normal thing because normally everybody will be sitting before the judge comes in, but his own case, they try weigh him because they don't want to see him being wheeled into the wheelchair. So that will not look at him as he's being compromised and all that. So these are,
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 2
Okay. It still falls back to how I answered the issue of fall in  the elderly  Yes you have to, it's more like using the table to do the pros and cons of what you are trying to do for them. Okay. And you must make them see the reasons why these things are very important, important as against them being culturally and, and, and certain of it. So it's not as if you are doing away with their culture, but we're still trying to tell them that I respect your culture fine, but if you don't do this, this is what is bound to happen. Okay? Mm-hmm.  respectfully as much as possible. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, Particularly where cultural beliefs of parties are involved?
Speaker 2
Okay. Now as much as culture is a way of life, but at the end of the day it's still this family or relative that was still dealing with the patient or their loved on alone that I remember I said that we are displacing  the place of culture but we are still looking at, that's the thing I want to bring in now caregiver burden. Okay. Which is very, very, very, very important. So by the time you enumerate what happens to a caregiver using that caregiver burden now because of them allowing culture in prepared with prescribing or use of mobility aids. Okay. Maybe they can be more accepting of fit or being a bit flexible about accepting the use of those mobility aids. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted client health or quality of life?
Speaker 2
Okay. I don't know whether this helps as an example, but I once say the patient,
Speaker 1
Okay,
Speaker 2
That is using a walking stick and I think it's a walking stick that the grandfather sort of, it was more like an inheritance let's say. Okay.
Speaker 2
But the way the special was working has bilateral OA now from the assessment and everything, I've really noticed that the working stick is no longer viable to be used. Okay. The working stick is actually unstable for him because of the need and all that. But at the end of the day we were able to convince him to switch from the working stick to his frame, respecting his culture. So it was more like we did nothing to do away with the working stick. It's more like we say okay, because you chose this and all that, we are going to keep it in a, in your sitting room. It's more like um, um, like an antique per say so that I can see you to remember your father. Yeah. You still have to use this nothing. So that I can still help you with. Okay. And I made a joke about, ah, if you don't drop this working stick you might have to join your father immediately <laugh>,which you laughed about. So that was to get
Speaker 1
Across. Okay. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 2
One thing I always try to do when I go to a new places that I don't, um, I don't try to force my own standards on the people. Okay. That is very important as a clinician, you have to actually understand what is important to your people. So I think by the time you do that, maybe they'll be much more accepting to whatever you tell them. Because if you have accepted their culture, no matter how, no matter how you perceive it, don't be too critical about it. Don't be condescending about it. Just find a way to understand it. So by the time you do that, maybe they might be much more accepting of you and want the people have accepted you, it's easier for you to get across to them.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility interven are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Sensitive and
Speaker 1
Appropriate.
Speaker 2
Okay. You see you use the interpreters now? Yes. Now one thing also I've always learned in my practice that, especially here in Nigeria
Speaker 2
Yeah. People,
Speaker 2
I mean language is part of culture. Yes. Culture is a way of life. Yeah. And people love it when an outsider knows how to speak their language. Language. Yes,
Speaker 1
Exactly.
Speaker 2
It sort of endears people to them. Yeah.
Speaker 2
So
Speaker 2
Being able to assimilate a people's culture actually helps you to mitigate or be able to um, please come again with that question. I,
Speaker 1
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health, health workers to ensure your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Sensitive.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 2
Hmm.
Speaker 2
Still balls  and from what I'm saying about accepting the people's culture, yes. Being able to speak their language, not necessarily being able to speak their language, but even making that attempt to speak it. Yes. So it makes it easier for you to get across to search people. Okay.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much for your time. I
Speaker 2
Alright.
Speaker 2
You're welcome.
Speaker 1
Thank you sir. Do you have any question, any
Speaker 2
Comments for me? Um,
Speaker 1
No, not really for that. I think the questions are, if question you need, sir, I've sort, I tackled some of the questions I would've asked myself.
Speaker 2
Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much sir.
Speaker 2
You're welcome.'''},

          "Transcript": '''Speaker 1
Okay. Good morning, sir. Go ahead. My name is senimatu and I'm a 500 level physiotherapist student, and I'm working on a project topic titled, exploring Physiotherapist Perspectives on Culture and Mobility among community Dwelling older adults. And by the end, end of this interview, I hope to have gained the aim of this research will be the, to understand and explore the rules of culture in shaping the mobility of community joining older adults in from the perspective of Nigerian. Um, so sir, uh, can you, uh, explain in your own words what you understand by the word mobility?
Speaker 2
Well, briefly, mobility is talking about movement from one point to another.
Speaker 1
Okay, sir, can you tell me what you understand by the word culture?
Speaker 2
It will apply from the people.
Speaker 1
Okay. Do you think culture affect mobility?
Speaker 2
It should because, um, whether you like it or not, before even the advent of physiotherapy, okay. People have their own culture tailored. Okay. We're talking about mobility. Well, mobility aids, yes. Mobility itself. People moving from one place to another, they have the ways of
Speaker 1
Movement. Okay. So
Speaker 2
You cannot separate culture entirely from mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay, sir? Yeah. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 2
Yeah. For example, not, uh, there are some culture, the kind of, uh, mobility aid we as physio therapist may want to prescribed. So then they may see it as anti-cultural. Okay. Yeah. Because, uh, in this part of the world, sub-Saharan, especially looking at our Nigerian as a case study, not many people want people to know that they're sick. Okay. And by the time they see you using one kind of, um, what you may call a strange mobility aid, okay. To then everybody begin to question and assert a lot of, um, illness or conviction to you. Whereas that is not actually the reason why we're using it. I'll give you an instance. Not many cultural background are used to cultural is like Zimmer frame Okay.
Speaker 2
Or the use of, um, like elbow crutches. Yes. Or go to things like wheelchair. Okay. So to, to many. The thing that when you find the patient on wheelchair, as far as they're concerned, yeah, it, uh, it potential portrays a very serious kind of illness, which to them there may be no remedy. Okay. So it's like you're sentencing a patient to date. Yeah. So even when many of them would've loved to have that kind of mobility aid, but they're looking at the cultural background, what may be the perspective they thinking of the people. Yes. So they're already exposing themselves to the community or to their cultural, like one that is not only having an ailment but there may be no remedy, so they wouldn't want to use it. Okay. But also when you look at some of them, mobility for example, like walking stick. Yes.
Speaker 2
It's, it's a cultural, um, uh, kind of, um, uh, immobility of walking aids, Okay. And in some communities it is given as part of a chief title, when you are given a chieftancy title, you are expected to walk, whereas they are looking at it as walking stick, we take it as mobility aid, aid okay. So, uh, if you have a walking stick and a, a walking frame, yes. And uh, maybe you have an uh, elbow crutches or even a auxiliary crutches, for example. Yes. As an option. Probably you want looking at terms of stability as a, so therapist would prefer a is zimmer frame as a walking aid Yes. But because of the perception at home, the man will prefer a walking stick because using the walking stick this days, now yes, people may look at him that maybe this guy has been given a new chief fancy title.
Speaker 2
Yes. So not knowing actually it's for therapeutic purpose. Okay. So from the cultural background, they may prefer a walking stick, even if that from the perspective of the physiotherapist, it's not the appropriate and ambulatory or  mobility aid. So you see that under that circumstances mobility is being a sort of, um, uh, affected by the cultural, by cultural choice. Okay. So the, yeah. Whereas as a physiotherapist we have a diverse form of mobility. It's, but sometimes the cultural belief, yes, we still go a long way to determine what the patient will want to choose. And again, it become very, very real expedient. When we are looking at like in public health, where I major, okay. When we're talking about the issue of what we call compliance. Okay, compliance, yes. Adherence. Yes. That is what we as a physiotherapist expect from the patient. I have prescribed this walking aid  for you a Zimmer frame, they may take it from you at the hospital, okay?
Speaker 2
But by the time they get back home, their cultural belief, yes, their cultural background, we take the man back to walking stick. Okay? So in which case, maybe the day the man is coming, let us see as an outpatient, the man is coming. He may come down with that Zimmer frame. But you, you don't know that when he gets him you go for the walking stick stick. Okay? So that is why in today under public, there's what we call concordance. Okay? In concordance you need to actually find out the challenges the patient have. Yes. I see. And you'll be surprised the challenges can be cultural related. Okay? The culture may be the one of the challenges. Not that doctor that I don't like physiotherapist. I don't like this Zimmer frame Yes. But in my community, the way they see it's a very bad way. So I would've preferred the walking stick, walking stick.
Speaker 2
So today in concordance we don't talk about adherence or compliance. That is what the physiotherapist say. The patient must do it. Yes. In concordance you try to reason with the patient who of you must come to a point. Okay. Where the patient will tell you, not that I don't want to use it, but from the cultural background there's a lot of um, what I may call um, stigma. Okay. Attached to it. Yes. So doctor, is there any way I can use this walking stick? Okay. In which case you have to work with the patient as a physiotherapist to see how the patient can use the walking stick. Because whether you like it or not, the patient agrees that yes, I'll use the Zimmer frame immediately they get back home. Yes. Because of cultural belief. The patient go back to walking stick and you know the effect of that. Yes, the walking stick will not afford the patient enough stability. And what are you going to get? We're talking about the elderly is fall. Yes. And form may result to other fatal are complications like uh, trauma to the health and so on and so forth. So culture has a lot to do when it comes to mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay? How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
That's what I've just told you. Okay sir. So I've just told you yes. Hmm? Yes. And again, that is where like I take you back to adherence, compliance and concordance. Okay? Okay. Okay. Knowing fully where that even if you prescribe the best mobility aid, for example for the patient, the patient may not worry with you, especially when you are the kind of physiotherapy that does no want to hear from the patient. Okay, I have told you to use, use it, no big deal. I go with it. Yeah. By the time I get to the village, dump the Zimmer frame  and give me the walking stick.
Speaker 2
So incorporating it you  must adopt what we call the concordance concept. Okay? When it comes to behavioral, uh, model, that means you talk, don't worry, eh? This is when uh, when you maybe inside your house you use it, use this Zimmer frame when nobody sees you. Okay? Maybe when you want to go out can use the walking, you can use the walking stick and also get an assistance. Yes the  side your wife or maybe your children, they can give you little support or caregiver, okay? Because that stick is not strong enough to give you the kind of stability that they may prevent you from fall. Okay?
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you sir.
Speaker 2
I hope say  this thing not too long.
Speaker 1
Yes sir. How do you ensure your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Again, put it
Speaker 1
How, how do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive are appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Yeah, for example, that the, the bottom line, like I told you have to do with balance. Okay. And yes. Then number two, you also have to look at the environment. The patient is going to use such a mobility enhancement, uh, needs or strategy. For example, the floor. Yes. So you must ensure that the kind of mobility aid you are using, for example, must have a very good storm. Okay, very good storm that can adhere and the, the floor must not be like all those ties must not be litter with water and so on. So anything that enhanced slippery, yes or fall of the patient must be completely warned against Okay ahead. So,
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you sir. Can you give an example of how you have modified your As or or how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate your client cultural belief
Speaker 2
For I just told you one for example, if my prescription is the Zimmer free. Yes. And because I know that there are culturally, culturally related uh, challenges, challenges
Speaker 2
To the optimal use of that eh, mobility aid by my patient, which I know for example, like me from my public health background, I know that this kind of behavioral conduct will not encourage the patient to use it. Yeah. So the best thing, like I told you the modification is that within your compound, within your home, try as much as you can to use it. But when you are going out, number one that walking stick yes that the community give to you. Because even these days, it is even modified it is even our cane, even our cane Yes, the English one, yes. That is the one they use go to most communities now. So thank God all of them is generally accepted. Now there's no big thing about that, but I still think that is not stable enough for you in other ways. You must get a little support from your, from the caregiver, your wife or your children or relations, okay. As you go about to use the working Aid. Aid.
Speaker 1
Okay sir, how do you educate clients about the importance of mobility? Why we expecting a cultural belief or practice
Speaker 2
Practice? Yes, I've just told you that the, in short, because we always go back to public. In public there's what we call protection motivation theory. In protection motivation theory,
Speaker 2
The what you do is that you must be able to educate your patient on the importance of the mobility aid for example. And while you are trying to educate the patient, some of the content of what you are telling the patient is that look, if you use this thing, these are the advantages. Okay? For example, we graduate, yes. Like you start from maybe Zimmer frame then , we can go to crutches. From crutches, we can go to cane. Okay? And that is not going, you are not going to be on it forever. There is a level we get to throw it away. Okay? But the patient knowing fully well this is not going to be a continuous process. Yes. The patient may want to abide you to, and again under the uh, the protection motivation theory, the threat you add to it is that if you don't use these things the way they they're being prescribed, there is a likelihood of a fall.
Speaker 2
Okay? And if you fall, the fall, you can hit your head anywhere, you can sustain a, a head injury. It can be a traumatic brain injury that can send you into coma for years. You may not even recover. And the day you'll die, you'll die in a very sorrowful mood. Pressure sore here and there. So threats are being added. Okay? So by the time you tell them, man, look, by the time you, so still traumatic brain injury because of fall because you didn't, uh, apply the appropriate um, uh, prescribed, uh, mobility aid. If you fall, you become unconscious before you know it, there is better here and there and they can be bed sores here and there. Nobody want to come near you, you are being a burden and you become miserable. So if you put a little threat into it, the patient, they want to ensure that whatever you prescribe, yes, they follow it, abide and follow it up. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. And in your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adults from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Yeah, a lot of cultural, the part of what you need to to think about is that, for example, find out the perception of the patient, okay. Concerning the use of whatever ambulatory aid you are giving. Giving, okay. Yeah. Find out the, the, the not only the the the the the perception also the, the, the cultural uh, perception concerning whatever mobility the patient is going to use. So you don't need to, don't shy away from it because if you don't ask, they're already there. They are the cultural uh, uh, background, you cannot erase it. Yes. So whatever perception the people have at home yes. Concerning whatever, uh, um, uh, mobility aid you are going to give. Okay. We affect the usage of that mobility aid by the patient. Okay. Or not the patient may decide to use or not to use it depending on how the people at home Okay. The community, what they think about it. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or interventions?
Speaker 2
Yeah, like earlier. Say that number one you there's what we call coping strategy. Under the coping strategies. Like look at restricted areas where the patient will likely find challenges with it. Okay. Try advise the patient or the clients still use the most stable one. Okay. Eh. And again, when the patient have any course to go outside, yes. And he or she cannot use the most stable one. Like uh, earlier said there must be an external support. Okay? The patient must be aided. So you get a much lesser uh, unstable working. If for example, like a walking stick with the, that is generally accepted within the cultural background okay. And also advise somebody else and that the caregiver or any of the relation to also assist. Assist. So you know that to have a balanced mobility. Thank you
Speaker 1
Sir. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when belief of practice are involved?
Speaker 2
Uh, yeah. Uh, although that, uh, that question had had earlier the answered, but it's also good. It's very important whenever you are educating the patient on the best ambulatory aid to use when to use it. And it is any need for any support, it is good you have the caregivers or the relations right there. Yeah. So that whatever instruction you are giving to the patient, whatever coping strategy you want the patient to adopt the relation, the caregiver then must also be away because they're also going to be involved exactly when it comes to uh, if the cultural background does not allow the most appropriate uh, mobility aids, they don't allow it, that there must be a coping strategy where whereby the caregivers or the relation they need to support. So it is very important that why you are giving the instruction, the education to the patient, the caregiver the most will be there.
Speaker 2
And again, sometimes there is need to also disabuse their mind even concerning their so-called cultural belief that this thing that because that thing you must also find out from the patient what is actually the, the problem. Why wouldn't you want to use this thing? And it may tell you, yeah, there are reasons why they may not want to use it, use it that they say general believe that when person see you with a Zimmer frame or see you with a wheelchair, it is believed that you are gone. That whatever image you have is so serious that you cannot recover. Let them also know that it's not in all cases, it's not in all cases. And also educate them that in choice of mobility aids, that there is, uh, they're being graduated. Okay, whatever the patient is,  is not going to be forever, forever the time we come where he or she will be winged get out of this mobility aids yeah. Then the patient will not work freely. So disabuse their minds. Okay, thank you. Susan,
Speaker 1
Can you share an example of a surgical mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client's health or quality of life?
Speaker 2
Yes. Uh, like a rightly told you that there was a patient of, uh, of mine, a very elderly woman who was asked ask to sit on a wheelchair mm-hmm.just to take her from the, from the car to the, uh, hospital bed. She said,
Speaker 2
Uh, the kind that she's a priest to one of those Goddess that it's not allowed that being priestess that she should use a wheel chair Yeah. So we have to do a lot of pleading that this thing has nothing to do. Yeah. That okay. We don't have people that are hefty enough not to come and pick you because that's what they used to do at home. This hospital setting, we don't have people, the best way of doing this thing is to place you on a wheelchair and take you down to that place. It has nothing to do with the priest to the Goddess. So the, it was a real challenge and if you look at it, the challenge we actually had was born out of her cultural belief. Yeah. That as a, a priestess to one of those, uh, goddess that she cannot use a wheel chair, but we were able to convince her.
Speaker 2
Okay. And again, we also let her know that, uh, because when she was going to complain that if this is what they're going to be doing whenever she come to the hospital, she'll never come here again. So, but we are able to disabuse her mind okay that this thing has transient, it's only for a while. Yeah. Our purpose as physiotherapists is to ensure that she get back to her feet and she walk unaidedly So we, we see many cases like that and uh, we see many cases like that. Recently, it was even yesterday I saw him, man, he was walking with the conventional hemiplegic gait and I told him that no, you use your walking stick. He left his walking stick. But he said he is trying to do everything that he, he doesn't want people to know. I said, the more you control that this, the more your problem will be prolonged. But if you use your walking stick, you'll get outta this problem and say, I say yes. So from time to time we normally have issues with mobility aids  with patient that have a very negative culturally belief or so, it is just stigma for something what is actually the, the,
Speaker 2
The negative cultural. So it's just stigma. Yeah. Wrong belief, yes. That once we are with walking aids and that it means you, your illness is so bad and uh, maybe some other that things like cross and so on and so forth. So thank
Speaker 1
You sir. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Yeah. Apart from uh, uh, the usual wide reading, again, you also have to be very, okay, so have to be very inquisitive Your approach to the patient will actually give them the room to unveil a lot of challenges they may have you. So that is where whether during your assessment or during your interactive room with your patient, you won't be patient enough to try and elicit reasons why they think so. So mobility aids is not being encouraged and they actually on, you want some of the cultural belief cultural differs? Yes. As far as the sub Sahara around the region, general is concerned. The eastern culture, the western culture, the northern culture and the south side, they all have different cultures and they have different beliefs. Yes. So you cannot use one across the board. So tend to have a very, very, um, uh, in depth yes, uh, uh, interaction with your patient. Don't try and find out the challenges they're having. Try and know why the challenges I do. And so, and uh, are you going to, you going to get more information, some of them which you may not even get from any written documents. Okay. So working closely with your patient who afforded the opportunity Okay. To know one, the cultural, uh, challenges, obstacles or challenges. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Uh, well sometimes maybe during our clinical meetings, for example, we, we do invite professional from other course. Okay. So not only for them to know exactly what we are using Yes. In case they have any, uh, contrary view, yes, they can also let us look. Okay. And sometimes too, during like, uh, for example, I'm the coordinator of the grand wardround. here. Okay. There are some situation we are allowed whoever is going to, uh, take us on that grand ward round to bring their patient down to us. Okay. So we come just like our usual seminars. So we tend to find out from the patient or the caregivers why, so, so yes, mobility aids are not being used or why they prefer it and sometimes they'll give you their own, uh, perspective Yes. On why it is being encouraged or discouraged. Okay. And that in their community and so and so forth.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much for your time. You have any question? Any comments for me
Speaker 2
Sir? Uh, well the, the only comment I like a to report, yes. Uh, do experience matters. Also try and look at the, the designation to then number two, uh, let also also have an outreach.
Speaker 1
Outreach. Okay sir.
Speaker 2
Have an outreach to communities if the elders and also find out, uh, as a advancement of this uh, study. Mm-hmm. I would also prefer the community outreach program to find out from the community as far as cultural is concerned. Mm-hmm. So we go to different communities and find out their cultural believe about mobility aids is going to also guide us. Okay. We are physiotherapist so let us go to the community and find out from them their belief. But all those mobility aids Okay. Alright. So that a feedback would be of, uh, immense contribution to the burden of, uh, work so that the elder was always need mobility aid. Yes. The elder, they always need to work for one place to report the advantage are so new mirrors. Okay. And as which therapies, we need to let the elderly know why they must move. I'll not also let them, when they move, why they must move with stable mobility aids, we must let them move. So I'll also abuse their mind against any negative cultural belief that has to do with mobility.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much sir. I really appreciate sir.'''},

Okay. Good morning. Good morning. My name is senimatu, I'm a 500 level physiotherapy student and I'm working on a project topic titled exploring physiotherapists perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adults. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adult from the perspectives of Nigeria physiotherapist. Um, so I'll be,  I'll be asking you some questions.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
Um, um, can you define mobility?
Speaker 2
Um, mobility is, um, um, movement, the way of moving, um, the patient from one point to the other.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you define culture?
Speaker 2
Uh, culture is the way people, uh, de behave, uh, their, their belief. Okay. And their way of doing things.
Speaker 1
Okay. Do you think culture influence mobility?
Speaker 2
Yes, it does.
Speaker 1
Okay. And in what way do you think it influence?
Speaker 2
Yes. When you look at mobility as a form of movement and, um, in some, uh, how does it affect? Affect? Yeah. Um, the, there are some culture where, uh, they don't believe in using, uh, modern, uh, mobility issues. Okay. There are some, you know, culture, religion means together too. Like, um, you have Muslim, they have, um, Muslim, they have the way they pray. Okay. Uh, there are some culture where by a, a, a the same sex Yes. Cannot attend to that same sex in terms of coming to the clinic. Okay. So like you have a Muslim in the north. Yes. Like wearingv hijab. Yes. You cannot mobilize that such patient. So that, that's a way, what can affect, affect
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse Koha background?
Speaker 2
Um, well this is benin is a crossroad where you have, um, but you don't have majorly beyond this zone of people. Like you have few hausas. Yes. Uh, you have few hausas and, um, maybe more of, uh, the igbos Yes. Yoruba. And now, you know of hausas are increasing but not as much as, so, um, you, you benin us not a cross  pomilitant city where you have almost everybody like Legos and kano. Yeah. But you still have some tribes around here.
Speaker 1
So the experience has been good overall.
Speaker 2
Yes.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Yeah. Like I mentioned before, if, um, if, uh, there culture, uh, can serve as a barrier of how much you reach out to a client or a patient. So Okay. If, uh, if the culture does not permit you Yeah. You may not, and you don't have in the situation where you don't have, uh, the other sex. Yeah. Then, uh, you have difficulty. Okay. So
Speaker 1
How do you now do this? Like in what way?
Speaker 2
Um, sometimes you may need to, you may need to get, um, that same sex, but if you don't have such people yes. Then you get assistance, they can help you. Okay. To, to break that barrier.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you ensure your mobility enhancements strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client?
Speaker 2
Can you repeat that?
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Yes. It's very important because, um, like, um, I give you a an example, yes. You need to understand people's culture. Okay. Uh, usually the, the Muslim. Yes. Um, a Muslim woman will not come into your cubicle and say, expose your body, you're treating the back pain or whatever. Yeah. So what you do, uh, either you get a chaperone or get a, a physiotherapist who is of the same sex Okay. Can attend to, to that uh, patient or you get somebody to be present with you. Yes. Those are the strategies that you use. Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate your client's cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
Um, well, we've not had such experience yet, so I mean not, we've not had such experience.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I believe that you must, uh, that the therapist must have understanding about the culture of the people, what their dos and don't Okay. Is from that perspective that you cannot educate them Yes. To get the best of what you want to get in terms of the interaction.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when accessing or addressing mobility in older adults from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Um, the, the culture may be in terms of, um, exposure of body parts. It may be in forms of, um, sex. Okay. Uh, you know, if a female, a female female clients are male. Yeah. Uh, so all those you take into consideration.
Speaker 3
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program intervention?
Speaker 2
It is education.
Speaker 3
Okay.
Speaker 2
Patient education for and client education. Education. You educate them properly and let you stress the importance of, uh, the assessments and evaluation and what gains the intervention we have.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural beliefs or practice are involved?
Speaker 2
Yes. Uh, you know, there is that we call home program. So if, uh, you have family members, you need to thoroughly educate them on what they can do. Yeah. So, and they can practice it in your presence.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you en Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted client health or quality of life?
Speaker 2
We've not had such experience.
Speaker 1
How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client mobility level?
Speaker 2
Uh, it is for you to get, to be, to be informed of you have, as a practitioner, you need adequate general knowledge. Okay. You don't restrict yourself to just, uh, because you're a physiotherapist that the knowledge you have Yeah. Alone is just restricted to, uh, physiotherapy. Yes. Physio, therapist supposed to have adequate knowledge about current affairs, culture, belief, dos and don'ts in certain areas as it relates to your practice. Okay. And so you must keep informed, you must be updated from time to time, not just professional knowledge alone. Yeah. But knowledge about the culture, belief and other things, general knowledge. Okay. And that,
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Uh, when you identify the, the cultural barrier barrier or the, there will be, uh, difficulty, uh, in what you want to do, uh, you have to engage them. There are platforms where you have, um, organizations that are doing this formally. Okay. And there are period, there are areas where you go into schools. There are some schools that make provisions for that, like college of education, um, or some private individuals. Some will be paid, some will not be paid. Okay. Then as long as you get the results.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much for your time. We're done. Yes. I'll, do you have any comments,
Speaker 1
Recommendation for me? Um, not now.

Okay, good afternoon ma. My name is senimatu. I'm a 500 level physiotherapy student. I'm working on a project topic titled to exploring physiotherapists perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adults.  And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adults. In your own understanding, can you please define mobility?
Speaker 2
Mobility has to do with, um, movement from one place to another. What we do majorly  So it has to do a movement.
Speaker 1
Okay. Um,
Speaker 2
That could be with, it could be with aids as well. It could be with you yourself. It could be with assisted devices. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you define culture
Speaker 2
Is the total way of life of, in an area.
Speaker 1
And do you think culture influences mobility?
Speaker 2
Yeah, in a way it does.
Speaker 1
Why do you say culture Influence mobility.
Speaker 2
What do I say? Culture
Speaker 1
Influence mobility
Speaker 2
In situations whereby someone is having, um, mobility issue. Yes. And it's been believed that using assistive devices is, is associated, is associated with um, something, maybe some belief system. Yeah. Some people will not like to use the assistive device, so in a way it influences.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse social background?
Speaker 2
My experience with clients? Yes.
Speaker 1
Diverse cultural background
Speaker 2
Background, it has been Relatively good. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessments?
Speaker 2
Into my mobility assessment. Cultural consideration. As I said earlier, there some cultures believed that  using assistive aid is shows that you are, especially when it comes to younger people. Yeah. Like using assisted aids for younger people shows that you are, you are segregate them. Mm-hmm. and they tend to see them as maybe being not strong enough. Do you understand? Some people have that mentality. So because of that, some people don't want to use assistive devices, so they feel they could still manage themselves without the use of assistive device. Meanwhile, the assistive device would be of benefit. Okay. So
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive
Speaker 2
And appropriate for your clients? Do I ensure my mobility assessment strategies? Strategies, yes.
Speaker 1
Are culturally sensitive and
Speaker 2
Appropriate for your client? For my client, mm-hmm.  how I actually ensure that it's appropriate for them and would be the fact that I educate them about the importance of the so majorly education helps long way when I educate them.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessments or intervention plan to accommodate a client's cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. Lemme just as you said an example. There was a time I was seeing a patient, I think, I think it's Seven Day Adventist or something, and they have the belief that on is this Saturdays or on Sundays that they don't work. I think on Sundays they observe sa they said they had observed sabbath and I was actually to see that patient on that day on call . So the patient declined treatment and it was a critical case. So I needed to educate the patient about how it's important that the treatment is carried out on, on Sunday. Yes. And I, what I educate her about what sabbath means as well. So it's not like you are not doing an activity. Yes. I mean you actually cooperate. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2 while respecting?
Speaker 3
Yeah.
Speaker 2
How do I educate them?
Speaker 1
Educate them? Yes. And the importance of mobility.
Speaker 2
Of course. I'll tell them the importance of why they need to move. Okay. Because if you don't move, um, movement is life. Yes. So if you don't move, you actually tend to lose the function that you have
Speaker 1
The consequences.
Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. . So you, you are Yes. Immobility
Speaker 2
Of
Speaker 2
Immobility. Exactly.
Speaker 1
Okay. In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in other adults from different cultural groups? Cultural factors that should be addressed when you are assessing a patient. Cultural factors. Yeah, cultural factors. When
Speaker 2
You, when you talk of cultural factors, what are you looking into this money?
Speaker 1
Religion might be one they believed to might be another. Their perspectives where they view things
Speaker 2
Cultural factors should be considered. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Well
Speaker 2
Depending on the culture. Mm-hmm. that, that will determine the 'cause. Everybody, every culture has
Speaker 3
Um,
Speaker 2
Way their own belief the way they are every religion to us, their own belief system. Yeah. So depending on the culture, depending on the,
Speaker 3
Um,
Speaker 2
Religious, um, belief as well. I think that's the way to go. So
Speaker 1
Religion is
Speaker 2
Part of, is part cultural, I mean the tribe and all is also part can
Speaker 1
Say religion. Okay. The tribe that is can say race.
Speaker 2
The race is part, yes. Race.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 2
Education General, just educate the patients.
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may Okay. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, Particularly when cultural belief or practice are
Speaker 1
Involved? Okay.
Speaker 2
Lemme cite an example. In situations, take for instance a neurological
Speaker 3
Or
Speaker 2
Damage or neurological injury,
Speaker 2
Stroke.
Speaker 2
Some people believe in orthodox, those medicine, they believe in traditional and they so much older say that without that they believe that they can't actually achieve,
Speaker 1
Um,
Speaker 2
A recovery. So there's a need to actually break that mindset, educate them about the condition, that it's not something that needs tranditional, uh, practice. Okay. If you all can actually educate them about the condition, how it happened Yes. And how do could takes place. Yes. They would actually yields and I've done that several. And that help
Speaker 1
You also while educating this patient, you also educate the
Speaker 2
Caregivers. Caregivers as well members. Exactly. So it's the two way.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and out impacted client health, quality life and the successful mobility, which incorporated cultural consideration and how depart the client quality?
Speaker 3
Yes.
Speaker 2
Okay. Say for instance, a patients and and older adult and I had, um, a fracture. Yes. And for, um, let me say as at that period, we, we didn't want him to be put in, we didn't want a full weight bearing on the, on the, on the limb, That was actually affected. Meanwhile,
Speaker 3
He,
Speaker 2
He has actually improved so much and um, all we just needed was the assistive device. So what he inside, he can't use the assisted device because the way people will be seeing it. Do you understand? So we needed to, um, talk
Speaker 1
Modify, look for alternatives.
Speaker 2
Actually. Did you say modified? No,
Speaker 1
I was like, be an example.
Speaker 2
Oh, success mobility. Yes.
Speaker 2
I'm considering the culture. Okay. Mm-hmm.But the thing is that the culture is not supporting mobility. Yeah. Do you understand? Yes. So me supporting the culture Yeah. Will not give the patient a good quick recovery. Quick recovery. Yeah. So I need to educate the patient that this culture, it will not help you. Yes. So it is until the patient patient sees the fact that the culture is, are actually of Yeah. Before it is able to, um, abide by the idea of the mobility. Mobility. So I need to correct that impression of the culture. Gotcha. So that you'll be able to functionally use whatever they give.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. How you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client mobility level?
Speaker 2
Well, I don't go about asking for people's cultural practices. Like they're not close to me, like where I'm working at home. But when they come around, I get to know from what they say. So most times how I get to know about their cultural belief is when they say it. I, I, I can't know agriculturals belief system and all, but when they say that we don't do that in my own religion, it's not something that is accepted in my, it is just like, okay, in, in some religion, they don't allow male to treat. They are female and it's only males that are available or it's only females that are available. Mostly if the patient is actually going through a lot of pain, it will not even care. It forget the culture. True. But in cases where, okay, the pain is not severe, the condition is not so severe, yes. They still have the, um, choice of saying, oh, I don't want, I don't want to. Mm-hmm. But we just educate them, this is what is available. So if you don't do this, don't, if you don't go with it, then there's nothing we could do with that, with you then. So
Speaker 1
You stay informed by first time meeting
Speaker 2
This patient, patient and acting. Exactly. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and operate?
Speaker 2
Okay. There's what we call this, um, multidisciplinary team. Okay. So there's times we meet up and we discuss, um, condition situations and through that platform, yes, it has actually helped to disseminate some information. And for those that go into the, those that are community based, yeah. They get information how our, um, modalities are our own intervention would help and they could take that to the community. Okay. And spread news to them that okay. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Really appreciate. Do you have any comment questions for me?
Speaker 2
Question. Okay. What would be our own benefit from this? Like how would this help our treatments? Our, our practice this, your research work? Yes. How would it help us?
Speaker 1
That's why I'm actually doing this. Okay. Because I, I want it to be published so it can help other healthcare professionals, not just physiotherapist. Okay. All have like, radiography, doctors, nurses. Okay. So they will, they actually understand it, this influence of culture on mobility. Okay. Because most people tend to say culture does not influence mobility. Some say culture do influence mobility.
Speaker 2
Okay.
Speaker 1
So that is the purpose of this, um, the purpose of this research Okay. Is to understand if roles of culture in shaping the mobility Okay. Of other adults or community, other adults, yes. From the perspective of Nigerian  physiotherapists
Speaker 2
Okay. So for that's from our, for our own part. From my own part, yes. Okay. Okay. For what? Parters community doers. How do you intend to pass this information to them? Um, you know, most of them are not techn uh, technologically oriented. Yeah. Do you understand, so
Speaker 1
It's true, um, true that
Speaker 2
You're looking at different cultures now. Yes. Every culture has its own belief, their
Speaker 1
Own
Speaker 2
Belief system. So how do you think they will be of benefit
Speaker 1
From this research? Yes.
Speaker 2
Do you want to go to that extent of Okay. Going to different places and telling them about how mobility is important for their lifestyle and all.
Speaker 1
Someone actually, um, that made a comment, like I said, um, going outreach to this uh, community of the elderly to help them to understand this influence of culture on
Speaker 2
Their better so that they won't, someone
Speaker 1
Actually
Speaker 2
Talked about about it. Okay. So it would be better. Yes. Because the more they know. 'cause most people are actually ignorant. Exactly. So the more they're aware, the more they're
Speaker 1
Aware, yes.
Speaker 2
The better for them. I think you should put that into consideration. Okay.
Speaker 1
Problem. Thank you very much.'''},

Good morning, sir. My name is seninatu, a 500 level physiotherapy student. I am working on a project titled exploring physiotherapy, perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adults. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adults from the perspectives of Nigeria physiotherapists. Um, so that, um, can you then define mobility in your own words? Mobility.
Speaker 2
We are talking about the movement. Okay. That's it. That
Speaker 1
It? Okay. Can you then define culture?
Speaker 2
Culture? It's, uh, it's uh, it's a belief.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
It can be influenced by some other intrinsic, uh, factors that is particular to particular culture. You know, from the inception of that culture, the, their forefathers, what they believe, what they, you know, that's basically the way individual behaves in certain ways. That's culture. Okay.
Speaker 1
Do you think that culture influenced mobility?
Speaker 2
Yes. Capital? Yes. Okay.
Speaker 1
Why do you say yes?
Speaker 2
Uhhuh? Of course now, you know, you have some, uh, even some person that be walking in one funny way. Yeah. You know, people see them as a different human that this person might not, cannot not be a normal human being they are this, they are, we, they're, you know, different. A lot of it does.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 2
Of course. Uh, it's been interesting. Now, of course I've been, I'm from the west schooling now working in the south, south, so I have, uh, yeah, of course has really influenced my, my practice. You know, I've worked with different country. In fact, I'm a true Nigerian chef. I studied a lot from the west serving in the east. Now I am, I am working in the south, south, south. So I've been everywhere in the country, so, and I believe in that.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Of course, you, I firstly identify their cultural beliefs on a particular mobility. Even if someone needs Zimmer frame, for instance, there's the, the beliefs that regards to that mobility, you know? Yeah. Can make patient to be, to be rejected and rejected by the society. So you have to look for a way to bring that barrier and go for the one, the culture. It's, uh, uh, can gradually accept so my dad to make sure adjustment appropriately. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
It's part of what I've said. Know even if someone needs, um, zimmer frame for instance, and you know, it's not culturally accepted Yes. Or the time the person as it goes, you know, a lot of impressions. Yeah. So you have to walk, you know, you have to look for the one that could still serve that same purpose, but that is accepted by that, um, culture. Culture, you know, you have to work as a professional. You have to, because the, you have to break so that an individual will not be, uh, dejected and rejected by society. Yes. Our goal is community reintegration. Now the person cannot go back to community, so we have achieved nothing if that is the case. So we have to work around this to ensure that the person goes back to community and acceptable aid. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment to intervention plan to accommodate a client cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
Yes, we are, I've done that several now, even though we, we, we further a member of the teams, we, we give a uh, uh, what do you call it? Uh, a tripod. Okay. To a CVA patient. And immediately, no, sorry. Uh, not, not CVA patient. I think it's uh, okay. O.A a very bad one. Okay. And, uh, the individual went back to commence with the, with the heat and the condition was deteriorating. So we trying to find out why. Yeah. So he stopped using it, so he was not supporting the limbs again because of the, uh, the society, uh, perception. Perception regarding that, oh, this man is about to die, is this, and, and we came then weise a means we look for a better need support. Okay. Instead of, you know, that would take away some pressures. And so we worked around this and, and you know,
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Seeing fantastic results was realized. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural belief or
Speaker 2
Practice? We do that on daily basis. Okay. Yes. Because beyond what they are presenting with, we still need to prevent some other things. Yes. Like in elderly fall. Yeah. Uh, so they needs to know the importance of using this mobility heat. Okay. And then the way, even if the culture is not friendly with the mobile, they needs to know that it's necessary and the youth needs to use it. So by that you can educate, you can help them to educate the community and they can also do that community education. Yeah. So that they can easily be accepted in order not to Yes. Let them have other issue like fall, so that with them what's in their matter condition. You get it.
Speaker 1
Okay. In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in order adults from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
The factor that is to be considered? Yes. Cultural factors. Cultural factors, yes. You see, they believe as regards to mobility, you know, because it's cultural. There are medical factors. Now is okay, look at the floor, the lightning system, the environment and the it's cultural factor, you know, can be funny. Yeah. And it's different. Yes. From one culture to another. Exactly. So you have to look at those factor that is peculiar, like now in benin. Yes. Using a stick. Yes. Might be culturally accepting even if there is nothing wrong. Some use a stick, so that means someone having an issue. Yeah. The use of the stick is not an issue here. Yeah. So can you see it's cultural based, some culture, some locality. If it still a stick, yes. It's like you are half dead that, you know, a lot of things start, start having very funny impression about you that oh, this man is there and there and in fact in might even find to come out. Yeah. And before, you know, and if it's not coming out, you know, it's not easy or lose it, that will releases mobility, complication setting, and even might likelihood person. So it's, it's always good to to to identify the, the peculiar factors. Factors in a particular community, you know. Okay.
Speaker 1
So you belief it is one of the cultural
Speaker 2
Factors? Of course.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility
Speaker 2
Program? The most important is education. They need to know the need of using it. And then you educate. Education is the key. As a professional, you educate the patient, educate the patient, relatives. In fact, the caregivers are also part of the, the management team. So they needs to be educated and know the, so those are the way is one of the ways, in fact one of the main way to put all those cultural barriers as regards to the, so if they see the need, they know the importance and you educate them, you know, and of course these days some cultural beliefs are fitting out <laugh>, so the health education will play role mainly.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process? That's clearly when cultural belief or practice, I,
Speaker 2
Uh, it, it's, it's also, you know, educate the caregivers and teach them the basic service where caregivers have said caregiver is, uh, is part of their, part of the management team. They're part of the medical team. Yes. So the home programs, you know, you need to educate them on the need of the aid and now to take some preventive measures, not to have some complications as it gets to by that, if they're in the know, definitely the cultural barriers will be broken. And again, they will do just, and we enhance the, the, the clinical outcome of, of um, of the conditions we're managing. So health education also key.
Speaker 1
Can you share, uh, can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted client's health of quality of life?
Speaker 2
The one I've mentioned, you know, I cited one before. Yes. Patient with O.Aand that's given us fantastic results. I think that's a better example, you know, in C V A. Yes. Yeah. The one we had, you know, that one is all that way around because the C v A will try not to give an aid especially, uh, tripod or whatever. Unless if the patient is going to hold it on the affected side, you know, that should not be encourag neglect all that for the Zimmer frame. Yes. That, so we have done a lot of, uh, like the O.A I cited. Yes. So we went through the tripod tripod, we went for the knee supports. Okay. And that helped us significant results was college. So, you know, that's how we were able to solve that cultural issues. Yes. At the same time, fantastic clinical outcome was realized.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's
Speaker 2
Mobility? I didn't get it. Question.
Speaker 1
How do you stay
Speaker 2
Informed? Okay.
Speaker 1
About cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Uh, of course if you look at, you know, it's always this technology area now. Yes. So if you are in the particular community, the first like be now Yes, I can. If you ask me about culture to some I will tell. In fact, I will tell you significant part of it. Because when you are to work in a particular place, yes. One of the thing you need to do, understand their beliefs, the cultural beliefs. Yes. Eh, that will help your practice. And from there, and you can understand this better by engaging them, the people in the community. Yes. The social media is there, even from the way people speak dis call and, you know, be able to pick some cultural beliefs and all that through the media, even through the engagement of the community, you know, then you, you socialize with them from there, you, you get to know their beliefs and, uh, culture. And now we definitely incorporated your practice to get a better result. Because if there's no pot, you know, the, the, the results might, might be think.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or health community health, health workers to ensure your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Yeah, we even though this, uh, an urban setting, but we like, um, the one we have done. Yes. Let we give you an instant. We have done what we manage the patient and patient recover some extent. So we had to, uh, there was need then to modify the patient environment. Okay. So we invited, uh, um, you know, community, community nurse. Okay. You know, patient was to be handed over the case to uh, regard know how the community be behaves and their beliefs and all that. So we, we picked, in fact the house has to be modified in such a way that there will be, um, some level of improvement and there will be complications. So what I'm trying to say is that we handed over, in fact I could recall the OT also went to modify the toilet, the about lot. So we worked as a team, a team and to break all OT of cultural barrier. And again, here we have community laws that take charge as well. Especially if the patient  is going back to village. Yes. We called and then this, the situation, this and then even now try to, they know the committee better. Yeah. And then they just bring in those to consider those factors and then we, we guide them on uh, our aims, the goals, having they follow suits. Okay. Thank you very much for your time, sir. Do you have any comments? I don't have any comments. <laugh>. Okay sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.'''},

Speaker 2
Okay. Welcome development. A beautiful research work. Thank
Speaker 1
You sir. Um, so I'll, I would like to ask you some questions. Okay. Can, in your own words, can you define mobility?
Speaker 2
Mobility? Yes, sir. Is the ability of an individual to move from one particular spot to another. Okay. Another whole body or some body parts. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you define culture?
Speaker 2
Culture,
Speaker 1
Yes. Culture.
Speaker 2
Alright. Culture is simply, means a way of life. Okay. That is how people behave. Okay. Act and live. Okay. And there are some laws guiding them. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Um, do you think culture influenced mobility?
Speaker 2
Well, I don't think culture influenced mobility. Okay. Before culture there was mobility. Okay. So our mobility is part of someone's life. Okay. Yeah. It's, it's for creation, it is designed for human to move. Okay. From one spot  to another, another. So I don't see where culture can influence mobility.
Speaker 1
Mobility. Okay. Okay. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds?
Speaker 2
Well, I can, I can say that I actually have a great experience. Okay. For me coming from another part of this country. Okay. To, to dwell in another setting. Okay. Of the same country. Mm-hmm.what I'm trying to say, I stay in the north. Okay. I'm from the north. I moved to the south. Okay. So I can basically tell you that yeah. Culture plays a role in, in our society. Okay. Because they have different culture backgrounds and some are easygoing. Why some are not okay. But what you do is in the not, there are a lot of restrictions in terms of culture, but in south their culture give them freedom to access to some things which you cannot done. Cannot be done. Cannot be done in the north. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of this restriction you're talking about
Speaker 2
What this restriction, for instance
Speaker 1
The restriction in the north
Speaker 2
Yes. The restriction, what I'm trying to say Yeah. Is simple is that we as in the south,
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Our women are not restricted to some, some, uh, let me say they're not restricted to some of the work they we do. They do it. Yeah. Like what men do. Yes. Female here in the south are not restricted. Okay. But in the north, the work that the men do, yes. The female are restricted because of their cultural background. Background.
Speaker 1
Mm-hmm
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Um, how do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Well, I have not been, I've not thought of that. Okay. That mobility can actually, culture can actually affect mobility. Mobility. Why? Carrying out my assessments. Okay. Because one of the, the goal and the, the most desire of the patient is to be mobile again. Okay. So I don't see how cultural influence mobility. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you ensure that your mobility enhancements strategies this are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Well, I can't respond to this 'cause I have not in incorporate culture. Whenever I'm assessing, I'm assessing for mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client's cultural beliefs or back or practice?
Speaker 2
I think I still go with my last response. No sir. Go with my last response. I have not incorporated and I have never had a challenge when terms of mobility you find ations. Okay.
Speaker 1
So, okay. Culture. Okay. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural beliefs or practice?
Speaker 2
Well I can just say something here, but it's not, it's what I witness doing. Yes. Educating patients on the answers of mobility is also different from their cultural belief.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Well how do you 'cause their cultural belief does not, to me, does not limit someone not to be mobile. Mobile. Okay. 'cause when the patient was apparently healthy, yeah. The patient was mobile. Yes. Our culture was not restricted him or her not to be mobile. So why patient is sick, why then culture we restrict them to be mobile.
Speaker 1
Okay. So in your own ways when when, when you are attending to a patient, you don't see the need of this, their cultural beliefs or part restricting them for accepting treatment or intervention for physio therapist
Speaker 2
Part mobility. Just part learning. Mobility.
Speaker 1
Mobility where mobility
Speaker 2
Assessments that treatment can be, it can culture can influence but in terms of mobility, just mobility. Mobility, that's what I'm looking at for.
Speaker 1
Okay. In your opinion, what cultural factors should we consider when assessing or addressing mobility in older adults from different ethnic or cultural groups?
Speaker 2
I can in something. Okay. Which I believe I know where your research is going on, right? Yes. Um, for instance now, yes. When you are approaching a high profile person that believes so much in culture. Okay. Like the oba's Yes. The igwes. Yes. The srakis , yes. From different culture. Yes. Understand. Yes. The right sense is that it's not that the mobility is the factor. Yeah. Okay. The mobility, the, the question is the command given to the those high? Yes. Because indirectly you cannot, some of the indirectly you cannot communicate to them. You don't? Okay. You have to go through a close associate to them. Yes. Okay. And some of them feel like maybe you are giving them an order. Yes. I understand. Yes. So it's, if you're looking at that angle, that's where we feel like to me it's not even a culture, it's like a high profile. People who have higher profile authority in the society tend to have these factors of limitation when it comes to intervention. Intervention and management. Okay. Of patients
Speaker 1
So that is the only cultural factor you feel that should be considered when assessing Yes. Mobility in other adults from different cultural groups. Okay, so you mean it's just the hierarchy. So hierarchy is also a cultural factor that should be
Speaker 2
Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2
When, okay.
Speaker 2
Yes. The profile of the individual in this society. Yes. Okay. And you rank attained? Yes.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program intervention?
Speaker 2
Well,  Followed by my last response. Yeah. In a way out of this is to educate them the benefits of mobility, what you are actually doing in case of mobility. Mobility, there any intervention is anything even I need to indicate I know the importance of what you are actually doing. It'll go a long way to eliminate  the barriers of cultural belief irrespective of the starting of the individual. Okay. Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural beliefs or practice are involved? How do you engage your family members and the caregivers?
Speaker 2
Actually I can say before I have not had any challenge. Yes. Regard in culture, cultural affecting mobility. Yes. So if I respond to your answer, it's like giving an abstract Okay. Of what I have not experienced before. Okay. Ahead. So I been able can skip that question.
Speaker 1
Okay. That means you don't actually follow up with these? Uh,
Speaker 2
From my experience so far,
Speaker 1
Yes. You don't, you don't consider culture?
Speaker 2
Yes. As a barrier.
Speaker 1
As a barrier for mobility
Speaker 2
Because mobility is one of the any innermost desire of any client of mine because mobility tends to help them to be independent to some extent. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you share, can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted the client's health of quality of life where
Speaker 2
I have not have an experience of that. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that impacts your client mobility level?
Speaker 2
Well I cannot say much about this because one thing I believe I just, I will still repeat myself. Okay. That mobility Yes. And culture Yes. Are two different thing though. It's can influence to some extent. Okay. But looking at mobility is, it's one thing that is a part of, sorry, mobility is a part of an individual Yes. Life style. Okay. Understand your lifestyle. So if mobility is not culture does not affect mobility. Yes. When the individual is holding. Yeah. So culture as well cannot affect mobility when the individual is ill  irrespective of who or he she is because whatever you see to that individual at that time mm-hmm that will enhance the mobility of that patient. Yes. The patient with desire and seriously about seriously taking the appropriate step given to him or her.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
So be informed. I just say we, this your study. Yes. We can. By the end of this study, I would like to get the conclusion of
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Of your work so that we can, so I can also be informed to make sure that actually mobility affects cultural, affects mobility. Okay. And this will go a long way in convincing me Yes. As a physio therapist. Okay. To, to start looking at culture whenever I'm accessing
Speaker 1
Mobility. Okay. Um, when you say culture, uh, influence a, a bit  or you say little  effects, what do you mean?
Speaker 2
I say it may, it means like I just give an example of high profile people.
Speaker 1
Yes. Okay. Or
Speaker 2
That,
Speaker 1
Okay. So
Speaker 2
It's indirectly but it's not directly.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
You understand it's like indirectly Yes. High profile people. Yes. Indirectly. It's not only about say mobility stopped, it's not the mobility that that is affecting, it's not the culture affecting the mobility. Yes. The culture is affecting the moral, the, the, the, the, the communication. Okay. Between you and the individual. Yes. Uh, that's the only thing hat I'm looking at. Okay. That means I'm not trying to say that uh, culture Yes. Indirectly, yes. Not directly affects mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay. Indirectly affects mobility
Speaker 2
Indirectly.
Speaker 1
Okay. Because of when you are looking at the hierarchy.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And the high high  profile.
Speaker 1
Yeah. There are some things you don't see there.
Speaker 2
Beliefs. Yeah. There are some things you don't say to such an individual. Okay. In as most ways. Yes. It's part of your treatment. Yes. Uh, assessment or anything. There are things you cannot do because of them and therefore can also affect mobility. Okay.
Speaker 1
Very interesting. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Well, I think after your research, yeah. I'll start thinking towards that direction.
Speaker 1
Okay, so you don't collaborate other healthcare professional? Yes. Okay. Let me to you now you actually don't think that culture actually affect mobility in any way.
Speaker 2
In any way.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much sir for your time and your effort. I actually appreciate Do you have any comment, recommendation question for me? No,
Speaker 2
No. I think
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah. Alright sir.'''},

Speaker 2
Good morning sir.
Speaker 1
Good morning.
Speaker 2
My name is senimatu, I'm a 500 level physiotherapist student and I'm working on a project titled to exploring physiotherapist Perspectives on culture and mobility among community dwelling older adults. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of cultural and shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adults from the perspective of Nigeria physiotherapist. Um, so, um, can you, um, in your own words, can you explain what mobility means?
Speaker 1
Talk
Speaker 2
About mobility. You're talking about movement and if you talk about movement, you talk about, um, moving the body as a part and moving the body as a whole. So we move the body as a part. Um, we are talking about as the body has components, the upper limb, the lower limb, head and neck, you can just turn the, move the neck alone or the head. Okay. Or move the upper limb alone. So that's a body parts movement. Okay. But when you now move the body as an entity, maybe the person who was sitting before now put the person into standing, the person now makes some steps. Yes. So that's a total body movement. Movement, yes.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you define culture?
Speaker 2
Okay. Culture is people's way of life. Okay. The way people do things, the way people behave, the way people dress. Okay. So everything about that speaks about their way of life is what I understand as culture. Okay.
Speaker 1
Do you think culture influence mobility,
Speaker 2
Culture and mobility?
Speaker 2
To the best of my knowledge, I think culture can, culture  can, uh, affect mobility in the sense that there are some people whose, um, their culture has made it in a way that, you know, the predominantly move around either to farm to fish and do water. A d L, uh, a d L. Okay. So those ones, they will tend to be more mobile in terms of their mobility than those ones. Their culture maybe limited them to, uh, being served. Okay. So they have slaves that serve them and then that are being served and not that, um, active in a d l. So it can also limit their mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background
Speaker 2
In terms of
Speaker 1
There
Speaker 1
Is any client at all?
Speaker 1
We
Speaker 1
Are dealing with older adults here.
Speaker 2
Well,
Speaker 2
What I have noticed is from older adults, especially the ones that are not, um, English literate. Okay. They tend to respond more to your physiotherapy practice or service to them with their dialect. So once you talk to them in their dialect, you see them responding more. Okay. But if you talk to them with, um, maybe English, English, you know, they might not respond. They don't usually respond to the
Speaker 2
Therapy. Okay.
Speaker 2
How, and then also another thing I've also noticed is it also depends on the, uh, tribe. There are some, you know, they'll see, uh, they won't want you to come and see, uh, they, they won't want you to come and like, um, they won't want you to come and um, see them. Like, they'll be like, um, this is a small person coming to treat them. Okay. That know this person should not. Yeah. And um, they'll just see it as, um, you are not, uh, in the cadel of the people that's supposed to see them, see them, see their nakedness and treat them. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessments?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh,
Speaker 2
How I incorporate that by first of all in my assess asking them the cultural background of the patient. Okay. Because you will see they say this tribe or whatever. So that will also help you by the time, you know, the culture or the tribal group the person is coming from that also guide you to know what and what that are prominent in their area and how to now vis-a-vis manage the mobility.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Okay. First of all, by understanding the culture of the person first, of understanding the culture the person is coming from. Okay. Then secondly, understanding the culture of the person. Okay. And then thirdly carrying the patient along. Okay. Yes.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate your client's cultural belief or practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh, once I had a patient, she was 68 years old. Mm-hmm. . So she had a hip fracture, which they reduced. So, uh, she, after the reduction, she was an admission in the female orthopedic ward. So I was called as a physiotherapist to come and mobilize her out of bed. So after my assessment, I noticed that at that point she can't even use Zimmer frame or walker to do ambulatory retraining protocol. Mm. So the best option, and they have discharged her, was to place her on wheel chair And the person in quote is, I, so what we mentioned wheel chair she say, no, you can't put me on wheel chair. That, uh, people from my side, once they see on wheel chair, they will think that your own is finished. That, uh, your, your condition is worst of all worst of conditions. Okay. So she was like, no, I cannot be on witch, I can't go on witch.
Speaker 2
So we have to try to explain things to her. Even when we finish explaining, she still insists that she cannot go home on wheel chair, so what we're not doing on that, uh, instance was um, uh, teach the caregivers, the siblings, sorry, the children of the patient on how to carry the mama from bed down to car where they now put on, took her home and then how to also carry her from car down, down inside to her house. When they reached their house before, um, the physiotherapist that we wrote a referral form. Okay. Or letter started coming to see mama and continue the ambulation. Okay. So that was how we now we modeled, we modified by not giving the wheel chair that insisted or not having by teaching the children how to now lift and carry her from one place to another because that's what the wheel chair would've done. Done. Yes. By the time you carry her and put on wheelchair, you not mobilize to the wheelchair. Yes. But since she said no to it, to not teach the children and the caregiver how to carry her from one place to another another.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting the cultural belief for
Speaker 2
Practice? Okay, first of all, I employed a, you know, when I assess a patient, I've noticed that this patient will be requiring this kind of assisted device for mobility for some that cannot, you know, get mobile by themselves Yeah. Than needs assistance. Yeah. So for instance, if the person is going to need, uh, wheel chair, like we have just said before, I'll first of all discuss with the person, see from the assessment I've done with you for now we are going to wheelchair usage for your mobility will be better. Okay. Pending the time you improve, we can now we can do or progress to another walking aid like the walker or crotches, but for now, based on your health status, you're going to use wheelchair. Then I also tend to, you know, ask the patient if he has any objection to regarding usage of the wheelchair that I have prescribed.
Speaker 2
So if he told me of his or her objections, I'll try to educate Yes. The patient for instance, letting her know that for now this is the best for you. So that to avoid fall from you and other things and give room for, um, your situation to improve better. And then you are not going to stay there for long or forever. Yeah. You just for your main time. Yeah. So after I finish educating the patient and the patient still insist based on their cultural belief, I'll have to, you know, give room for the patient cultural belief first before my
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in older adult from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Okay. Their perspective to,
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Usage of assisting devices for mobility. Okay. Should be considered. Considered. Yes. Because I believe that's where the problem lies. So once their perspective are considered Yes. And work upon, yeah. For instance, let them, for some that sees witcher is ages, that's the end of life. So once you educate them, the importance of the witcher that for now it's not like the person is going to be confined to wheel  chair  he just for a period of time, the person can now start either working again or use another working aid to work. So by the time you explain the importance and educate them more, and they're enlightened and believe it going a long way
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you. How do you address cultural, cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program?
Speaker 2
What,
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 2
Okay. How do I,
Speaker 2
Um,
Speaker 1
Address cultural barriers?
Speaker 2
Okay. I,
Speaker 2
I use, um, educating the client and the client, um, relatives, which could be the caregivers which would be the children, which could be their spouses or whatever. Their brothers, their sisters. Yes. Whoever the relative is or caregiver is. So you educate the patient, educate the caregivers, caregivers. So once I educate them from the medical perspective Yes. Especially the importance that opposed to Yeah. The clients. Yes. So that's how I Okay. Education.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregiver in the mobility assessment or intervention process, particularly when cultural belief or practice are involved?
Speaker 2
How do I
Speaker 1
Engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process? Particularly when cultural belief or practices are involved.
Speaker 2
Okay. Um,
Speaker 2
If a cultural belief or practice is involved. Yeah. Like there are some people, you as a male, they'll not allow you to assess a female alone. Yes. So what I will ask the patient is, who do you think can stay with us? Why do this assessment from your relatives? Okay. So the patient will tell me, I will let the person in. Okay. So the person will not be there. I will do my assessment. Yes. So that's, uh, one of the ways I, I do that.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted client health of quality of life?
Speaker 2
Okay. Um,
Speaker 2
Like the previous example I gave before. Yes. The woman that has 68 years, that had a fracture Yes. That I was told to come and mobilize out of bed who has been discharged. Yeah. You know, because the woman was holding dearly to the cultural belief more than yes, my counseling from medical perspective on the use of wheel chair. So I have to now like modify, which I know is not a better way of mobility for her because one thing is that it's going to pose more stress on the caregivers. They might come down with back pain. Another related work, um, related, uh, musculoskeletal issues. Yes. Unlike when you just carry the patient and put on the witch ear Yes. And road wheelchair or wheeled the wheel chair for the person, so it's less stressful on the caregivers. So I, I think the impact it has, yes.
Speaker 2
In as much as it was successful, we were able to mobilize him out of the bed Yes. To car to whom? Yes. But because it wasn't the right way. Yes. So I think, um, the impact on the caregivers, even on her too, because it also make her to live, um, more of a sedentary lifestyle because anything that they have to be carrying from one way the other, but when you put on a wheelchair, the person can even teach the person how to wheel the chair by you or herself. So, which is also a way of, you know, it's a sizing or moving the body, like just staying adamant. So I think, um, yes, in as much as we are able to achieve our mobility in both, the impact wasn't, uh, what is expected.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Okay. By engaging in some CPDs that, um, that train, uh, the physiotherapist more on how to mobilize patient. Okay. Then in mind their cultural value also by also studying the cultures of different peoples because that also guide you. Once you now encounter each of any person from different cultures, you'll know how to tackle the person in terms of mobility. Thank
Speaker 1
You. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Okay. Um,
Speaker 2
I always demonstrate. Okay. So even in as much as the person is interpreting, so after the interpretation, I'll tell the interpreter to also tell the client, watch me now that I want to demonstrate what I want him or her to do. So should in case when the interpreter is telling her, uh, something that she could not understand from different from what I'm doing. Yeah. He should signal, he should respond. Okay. So I always demonstrate. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Do
Speaker 1
You have any comments for me or question anything? Okay. Um, okay, for now, I, I
Speaker 2
Don't have question except maybe, uh,
Speaker 1
Comments,
Speaker 2
Comment for comments,
Speaker 2
Do you code the people you are interviewing, do you have what you used to code them? Yes. Yes. Or how do you know that the, what you have recorded now that it's for me? I was thinking maybe you, I don't know, maybe you asked him first you introduce the person you interview introduces or herself, they now use code to code the name.  when you are interpreting or when you are, you know, um, answering the research, uh, questions. So I was expecting that the first thing should be you asking me my name. Then as you explain your own name when you introduce yourself, both, I didn't introduce myself, so I don't know how, maybe you have another way of coding to know that this is what this person has said when you've be interpreting. Okay. So that's my observation and comment.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah.'''},

Good afternoon.
Speaker 1
My name is senimatu . I'm a 500 level physiotherapist student and I'm working on a project topic titled exploring physiotherapists  perspectives on culture and mobility and more community dwelling older adults. And the purpose of this research is to explore and understand the roles of culture in shaping the mobility of community dwelling older adults from the perspectives of Nigeria physiotherapists. And I would like to ask you some questions. Um, can you define mobility
Speaker 2
Basically? Mobility. The ability of someone to move from, to move from a place to another. Yeah. And if you not look at mobility in terms of function, is the ability of the patient to carry out functional activities from a particular place to another for functional purposes. Okay,
Speaker 1
Thank you. Can you define culture?
Speaker 2
Well, culture organize, define culture? Well, I can't really have an idea of culture, but I think culture has to do with the ability in which people tend to imbibe in their, um, um, local, uh, how you want to put it involved in their local doctrine or local whatever. I can't really give you a specific definition right now. Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1
Uh, do you think uh, culture influences not be example?
Speaker 2
Well, for me sometimes I'll say yes. Uh, but basically in terms of communication, it does influence, yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse social background?
Speaker 2
Well, it's been, it's been interesting. Uh, I would say it's been interesting. At the same time, I would say it's been very difficult actually when you are relating with a particular patient from a particular cultural background that um, they have so many rules and regulation. Okay. So for instance, if you're trying to move a patient from point A to point B, they'll tell you you are not supposed to touch a particular patient as in regards of their culture. Okay. They need a chaperone to help them move such patient, yours is to give instruction. Okay. Okay. So those are the difficult parts that we're talking about. Culture. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessments?
Speaker 2
Cultural
Speaker 1
Consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Okay. Cultural, um, consideration. Consideration, yes. Into, well, where that had to do with the full knowledge of what we are talking about culture. Okay. So, but if you had to put it into our modified mobility assessment, a yes. Yeah. Or interventions, is that what you're trying to say? So we could, can you pause?
Speaker 1
Okay. We're talking about, um, um,
Speaker 2
Modified abi No,
Speaker 1
How, how you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment.
Speaker 2
Okay. Alright. How you incorporate cultural consideration, consideration into mobility assessment. Like, you know, we are looking at the, the, their cultural background. Yes. Okay. Now, for instance, if you're in the north, yes. Okay. Or you have a north term here. Yes. Okay. It is not about the religion background, it's about their culture. Okay. Okay. So you see some requesting for a feminine to do or want to assist, but the most challenge we have at that particular time is that this particular female and not be able to carry out such. So you will have to find a way of incorporating maybe language. Okay. Maybe language into it so you find somebody that can interpret properly. So that will actually help us and give us an ideal assessment, okay?
Speaker 1
Okay. And when you talk about, um, this religion, so are you saying that culture and religion are,
Speaker 2
They're interwoven, they're interwoven, huh? They're interwoven, yes. You cannot say, you cannot say they're different. Okay. Religion, if you're talking about the culture, yes. We are talking about their, their ideals. Okay. Their way of life, their of life. I think that, that way, their way of life. But sometimes religion is more deep into culture. Okay. Okay. There, that's, I said there are interwoven if you're looking at people's way of life, you look at their religion as well. Yeah. Okay. So if for instance, I'm to see Muslim one and I want to ask her do an slr for me and she's not wearing anything underneath, she'll tell you she, she cannot , I need a male, I need a female chaperone. Okay. And if you have, if you don't have a chap, a female as a chaperone, it's a way that will affect a proper assessment. Yes. Okay. Yes. If the horizon we are doing in orthopedics, I ask the patient to take a clothes down for me to do a thorough assessment. At this point, yes, she might, she might want to avoid it as a result of a culture, of course. Okay. Okay. So that's one of the thing that will affect, eh, an assessment. I dunno if I got that right. Yes. Eh, thank, yes. Alright. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
Okay. Alright. Alright. On this, if you say mobility enhancement strategy Yes. If are culturally sensitive and appropriate for clients. Yes. Yeah. The basic thing is if you have a proper, have you've done a proper assessment. Yes. You also look at the patient's social awareness, which I feel that's why you're trying to ask me. I have to do with the cultural sensitivities. Okay. Now if you ask, I like using the nothing as, or the Muslim background because they do more of functional things like squatting. Okay. Squatting during praying. Yes. Sitting, having the awkward sitting position during prayers and having the same awkward position while having a family meeting. So if mobility yes, there is not attainable with their culture, I, I think it's going to affect the sensitivity. Okay. Yes. That's what I think.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client cultural duty for practice?
Speaker 3
What,
Speaker 2
How to modify? Yeah. How
Speaker 1
You, how you modify Any example of how you modify your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accommodate a client practice.
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. In terms of, um, he was talking about,
Speaker 3
Uh,
Speaker 2
In terms of um, in terms of um, um, mobility or modification of mod mobility and, um, patient, um, culture. Okay. You have to look into, first you have to look into the patient's cultural acceptance. Alright. And various mobility procedures that we are carrying out on the patient. And one key thing is the patient's condition. That's when you can actually modify. But when you are looking off, looking at mobility in terms of movements and their culture, okay, you have to, we, we, we tend to, let's say for pain now. Okay. Okay. How to modify such. You ask them to sit on a stool for those who cannot squat. So that's another way of modifying the,
Speaker 1
The
Speaker 2
Mobility assessment. Yeah. And of mobility. Yeah.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural mobility level?
Speaker 2
How do you
Speaker 1
Educate clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural belief of practice?
Speaker 2
Yeah,
Speaker 1
So that I think, how do you educate clients about the importance of mobility? Why respecting their cultural belief or practice
Speaker 2
Well, um, for older adults. Now, if I may understand your, your work properly. Okay. Now you know that mobility in older outdoors, eh, you look at this fact, first of all we'll ask you understand the fact that muscles are already weak. Okay? Alright. And mobility in them are reduced compared to the younger ones. Okay? So when I'm looking at culture, yes. Some will tell you that once you have an older adult, yes. Okay. They are supposed to be indoors. Yes. Okay. Yes. So you are, you are asking me my own program, have you or
Speaker 1
No, the importa, how do you educate clients about the importance of mobility? Why expecting their cultural beliefs
Speaker 2
Practice. Okay. Yes. And we, we, we, we'd still have to respect their cultural belief. Okay. But we still have to let them understand that once they allow them to be in a particular position, yes their muscles tend to weak more. Okay. So when I advise them not against their culture now, okay. Okay. Because we advise them to understand the importance of mobility, trying to move them from a particular place to another now not to be ambulance, not to be self ambulance, but maybe with supportive with relatives Okay. Around them to help move them from one place to another. Why following the guidelines of their cultural belief.
Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Then in your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in order from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Like your question,
Speaker 1
What cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility, other actors from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
What cultural factor factors?
Speaker 1
Yeah. Should be considered
Speaker 2
Cultural factor.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 2
Lemme see. I think cultural factor, I need to understand the cultural factor you you're talking about here. Okay.
Speaker 1
The normal cultural factors, like when we're talking, we're talking about religion
Speaker 2
Okay, well if, if, if we're looking at the cultural factor yes. And um, number, which
Speaker 1
Number five
Speaker 2
We're looking at the , what we put into consideration Yes. When assessing yes in mobility. Yes. Uh, we can look at the, we can look at their basic, um, religion. Okay? Now, now you know that once patient is are older, yes. Degenerative changes is one factor. Okay. That affects mobility. Yes. Okay. So the factor we look at is one that we may look at is religion. 'cause you find them, like I said earlier, yes. Difficulty in squatting for prayers. Yes. Okay. So they should find another way of addressing it. Okay. Okay. And another one is the fact that once you have these elderly people, there's restriction in carrying out some activities, which is as a result of their, their cultural belief. Yeah.
Speaker 1
When you're talking about this, this restriction, can you like mention some of these restrictions that
Speaker 2
In terms of religion? Yes. Now in terms of religion, the restriction is they insist or they still want you to still squat and pray. Okay. Alright. So imagine a a an elderly man. Yes. Who, who who has osteoarthritis or has severe lumbar spondylosis Yes. That cannot do all this. There should be an amendment for instance, correcting a suitable chair. Yes. For such the, the, the, the aim is to is to through hours, it is still to have the normal routine of prayers. Okay? Yes. So he can still actually allow that or even if he's going to sit on, on the mat, yes. There should be relative around to assist and take them up as a result of pain. Okay. Which can actually end their mobility. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you sir. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program intervention?
Speaker 2
How do we assess cultural barriers? How do
Speaker 1
You address cultural barriers? Yes. That may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program.
Speaker 2
What is number one that will say is to increase, to actually reduce the gap of knowledge? What I mean by gap of knowledge is, is to educate them more on the importance of mobility with their cultural belief. If they understand what it means in the older adults, yes. They will tend to, to close that gap. Hmm. Yes. And walk more. Like for instance, now lately they're creating chairs for politicians to sit in the mosque, even if they're Muslims. Okay. So they can do same. Yes. For the older, for the older adults. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or intervention process, Particularly where <inaudible>, where cultural beliefs or practices are?
Speaker 2
Yeah. Um, in that, in that part, every caregiver or relative should play a role with physiotherapy in terms of mobility and culture. Okay. Now, when we are looking at this, they are to be more educated regarding the procedure and technique in carrying out, uh, in encounter the procedures in mobility. Yes. And in relation to culture, yes. I'll also go back to the main culture. Yes. The religion where a male do not touch a female. Okay. Okay. So the family, the relative or caregiver should rather be a male to a male and a female To a female. So that this angle we're talking about, this gap we're talking about. Yes. We can easily fill them up in terms of knowledge. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration? How it's impacted client health or quality of life?
Speaker 2
Okay. Um, that's one of the examples I gave you earlier mm-hmm. Which had to do with religion. Okay. And the practice. Okay. Alright. Why carrying out this procedure? Yes. You bring in a relative to observe the procedure. Yes. It's more or less that you're giving that same relative an own program or a ward program to carry out. Yes. Okay. So why you are not there? You are asking the patient move this patient from point A to point B and if the cultural background Yes. Is saying I don't need a female to take me to the restroom, I need a nurse to take me to the restroom. Yes. So you advise and you make sure that they have a, a caregiver who is a male to help move or to help move this patient from the seedbed to the restroom.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you very much. And how do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
How do I how
Speaker 1
Do you stay informed
Speaker 2
About informed care
Speaker 1
About cultural parties and believe that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
Well, you know, with the way everything is evolving presently we have to read more about various cultural groups. We have to read more, have the knowledge about various cultural, cultural acceptance and that will help us imbibe. Okay. Yes. Stay informed. Yes. With cultural group and our interventions of physiotherapist.
Speaker 1
Okay. Thank you. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility interventions are culturally sensitive? Sensitive and unlike you? It's rare. It's rare for us to have the collaboration actually with interpreters. How many interpreters are using. That's, that's, that's, that's one challenge I feel we have. And yeah, that's one challenge I feel we have, but sometimes we might be lucky. Okay. Enough that a relative or a caregiver understands English and can help interpret to the patient and the patient will understand the, whatever we're saying in terms of their mobility. Okay. Or intervention. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much sir for your time. Do you have any comment, recommendation from me? Well, um, comment is, um, actually this first time of me coming across such research work and I think he's, um, he's um, quite interesting one and I'm just trying to see the relationship between culture, culture and mobility. Alright, thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. So I'll, I'll can't wait to read your, your work so I understand. Okay. All thank you sir. Yes sir. You're not saying after I've talked, dunno if what I've said you not, and you'd have given me this for.'''},

Okay. Good afternoon sir. Good. I'm good Afternoon. I'm a 500level physiotherapy student and I'm working on a project topic titled exploring physiotherapists perspectives on culture and mobility among community to older adults. Um, I want to get your view that is your perspectives and that to get how you view, um, the, the influence of culture on mobility. Um, what do you understand by mobility? Like in your own words What do you understand by mobility?
Speaker 2
We talking about mobility that would do with the, of moving. Other words not Okay. That's what we did. Other about movements.
Speaker 1
Okay. What do understand by culture?
Speaker 2
Culture has to do with uh, our belief.
Speaker 1
Okay.
Speaker 2
Their way of life. Okay. Our way of, way of life or belief. Okay.
Speaker 1
And do you think that culture actually influence mobility?
Speaker 2
I think so.
Speaker 1
Okay. Why do you say culture influence mobility In what way?
Speaker 2
Okay. I would say that culture likely influence mobility in the sense that if I'm a clinician, for example, okay, I'm a client or the patient comes around and there are some culture that believe that the men should not try to touch the women and we are trying to, after assessment, they want to make sure that they're mobile enough to move. Yes. And we'll be sensitive of how you touch them. We possibly patient want to fall, have to be 60 or not get towards a chance to. So that kind of intervention can mobility. Okay.
Speaker 1
Yeah. Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural background?
Speaker 2
Uh, describing my experience about working with clients with diverse cultural backgrounds. Of course, I would describe it this way that some patients, because ideally, uh, we are not supposed to be biased in our treatment, yes, we don't any medical bias. We are tend patients with cultural backgrounds, social, cultural affiliation, religious affiliation, whatever. Patients are patients under the prime reason, we attend to them. So describing these experiences is that because of how some cultures have behaves Someone somehow when you are, when you are trying to um, to ensure the mobility, you have to be guided. For example, someone suffers from stroke and goes to look traditional massager and possibly some damages have been done in the patient in the past. So as a rapist trying to give an that patient you have to be of whatever they've done in the past, not to their mobility. So that's describe experience.
Speaker 1
How do you incorporate cultural consideration into your mobility assessment?
Speaker 2
Incorporating cultural consideration? Yes. Into my, okay. First of have to respect everybody's culture. Okay. If your culture says this should not be done, so that's what you believe and that will be signed between me and you for, you know, to do that. Okay. So the way we have to incorporate is that I have to educate you and let you understand that oh, this is your culture and this is what we're gonna to do for you to get results. So by educating , I give you an education of what to do, what to do. I believe that you also support to my ideas. From then we'll achieve our plans together. Treatment plan is not just me. So education is the key in this regard. Okay.
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for the clients?
Speaker 2
Okay. Uh, ensuring that uh, patients mobility have strategies Yes. Are culturally sensitive Yes.
Speaker 1
And appropriate for the clients
Speaker 2
And appropriate for the clients.
Speaker 2
Okay. What I'll do in this case that knowing your culture and know your belief, like I talk about the, the definition of culture that do it a way of life or belief of group of people or individual. So looking at it is perspective. Once I have an culture is yes. So the plan or the strategy, how to devise in this case that whatever that will, that will infringe on your, your right or cultural rights, I will try to avoid as possible. One, give the best at uh, the best approach that will not infringe your cultural rights and belief. Okay. So whatever that is appropriate for that depends. I will treat you Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention to accommodate a client's cultureof beliefs or practice?
Speaker 2
Okay. Going further  with this going, we meet some clients that believe that the female gender, for example, a client that beliefs that a male should not touch them. So what I have to do in that case is that I have to involve the colleague who's a female to join the plan and the treatment plan. So when you do this, get to accommodate them that practice belief.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you educate your clients about the importance of mobility? Why you expecting a cultural belief for all practices?
Speaker 2
Mobility first of all is life. Yes. So the way we go about educating them is that first of all to need show, they have to give them an proper education by telling them that mobility is life and this is your culture. So trying to, I'm not against your culture, I won't tell you that I'm against your culture. I will believe your culture that this is what you believe. I say there's no problem but for so culture  and so reason this is what you have to do to help though it might not be belong with your cultural practice, but far you have to benefit you and you are in agreement with it, but you
Speaker 1
Get to understand what
Speaker 2
View of understanding Okay. And what you're trying to achieve in a person. Okay. With your clients. Okay.
Speaker 1
In your opinion, what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility in older adults from different ethnic or cultural groups when assessing a patient? What cultural factors should you consider from clients from different cultural groups?
Speaker 2
Please can you explain this question better?
Speaker 1
Okay. Um, you know we have cultural factor normally, we know that cultural is a way of life, the way people think, the way they dress languages. Mm-hmm. So cultural factors like races, gender and religious. So when, when assessing a patient or when addressing mobility with adult, what cultural factor should be considered when accessing them?
Speaker 2
When looking at this? Um, the cultural factorI we'll talk about. Yes. For example, we set an example of uh, maybe dressing when assessing them, Okay. So we, let's say for example to assist you in the woman. Yes. And they kind of clothes or clothing dressing is put may affect the way we assess that patient. I'm looking for that enhance, um, affect the of of that adult. Okay. What I would do is that I have to educate them in this particular dressing that this dressing blood to affect me work. Okay. So that know that aspect of dressing, you have to personally address that. Okay. You know that. So, and some courses I believe that you're walking, you know, you have to show level concentration and know that, and this time you have to also educate them. In that case you have to be careful. You have to guard yourself, ensure that you don't fall if an adult for really good problem because of osteoporosis. Yeah. You likely sustain fracture other form of bone injuries and that, so regarding the, the ambulation when you walk Yes. And the way they dress. Okay. This kind of cultural factors can actually the address.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from assessing or participating in mobility program or intervention?
Speaker 2
I, we address this by education and counseling. What I mean by this is that I know my people, there's a popular word that says that people die for lack of knowledge. This where your cultural beliefs but the cultural, the cultural belief is actually affects you negatively regarding mobility. So I have to educate them on the essence of this mobility and how it should be done. You respect of your culture, do your culture should be respected. I will have respect your culture, but your culture, see your culture is not in line with this, but this what you have to do. Patient move you until counsel tend to s come to your argue.
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment? Interventional process, particularly when cultural belief or practice are improved.
Speaker 2
Okay. In this kind of situation, some women for example are not want a male to touch their body during assessment. Know you are talking about assessment of mobility. A lot of this have to be assessed. You can't to be assessed the person structural systems to be assessed. So in this case you no want to be expect what you have to do. You have to involve your family members. Okay. Their caregivers like this is what I want to do. Okay. Services I cannot do can be affected to me. So inform them in this regards can help. Okay.
Speaker 1
That that means um, when talking about this culture and factors, that means gender to be one of another factor to consider.
Speaker 2
Yes. Yes. That part of the gender needs  to considered. Okay. Age too should also be consider.
Speaker 1
Okay. Can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural consideration and how it impacted that client health of that client health of quality of life. That how it helped the clients in their health of quality of life.
Speaker 2
Okay. With this um, example to be shared in the situation whereby, uh, person who believe in particular, uh, who has a particular belief based on his culture. Yeah. And said that, uh, I cannot uh, walk alone and not that somebody has to walk with me and that, so in that kind of case, you want person, you ensure that um, for the other persons yes. Maybe caregiver is also involved to ensure that the person does not fall because there are some, cause we'll tell based on one or two tell you that if you, you don't walk alone if not you will fall  and fall is not for an elderly person to fall for example, for to fall. So in that you to ensure that so many guides are involved and we can use the for place. For example, there's need for walking aids to be rendered for patients without walking aid. We ensure that patient balanced to prevent fall, some culture will tell you that eh, I should not for the hospital. It not something the hospital. Yes. So to prevent all that proper is given to ensure that patient does not fall
Speaker 1
Have you personally worked, like, worked with any, um, this patient or any clients from diverse and cultural um, cultural group?
Speaker 2
Yes, I have the opportunity diverse cultures. Okay.
Speaker 1
Can you give me like an example of how you work with the person, the success, the sources?
Speaker 2
Is it regarding mobility or
Speaker 1
Yes. Regarding mobility, yes. Like if you have personally work with, with the, with the client from another cultural group.
Speaker 2
Actually I've tried to reason out. I actually, I think the people with different cultures, yes I know that. Oh yes. Okay. The experience I had personally was time, uh, management stroke of patients. Okay. Who medicine and complications came as complications set in on the patient. And then I visit also therapy. So the way I the patient or give up my intervention was to ensure that based on what have been done with our patients damages and that, so with them around to ensure that properly getting the patient's mobility to ensure safety because the damage been done patients. So,
Speaker 1
Okay. How do you stay informed about cultural practice and belief that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
I to stay informed, first of all, uh, only I am glad  that I have attended several clients in the past. Yes, I'm aware of how cultures influence mobility uh, uh, most of the times negatively most of the times. So stay informed. The in sense is that I might have an idea okay of if, but people coming here what culture and this what they believe. Okay, this what they stick to. So community to play is I have to work along with their culture and provided they don't infringe on  their cultural belief. Okay. But what I'll try to do is that I try to give them guides, try to work along with them. Anyone that is detrimental to them, I try to avoid as possible whether, whatever they're doing, even culture support it because not the culture and don't have any detriment to the patients health
Speaker 1
 Okay. That would have to improve your knowledge about these cultural practices? Yes. Okay. How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
Okay. What I would do in this case that other, the professionals, um, have to inform them, okay, should be a aware of this particular patient coming from the culture. So what I will do is that collaborating with them, yes, uh, there's no element of knowledge, numbers and knowledge. So I want to collaborate. I also collaborate with them by also hearing their own perspective. Okay. Get information from them on how they can be of help. Of help to me and them having the patients, unfortunately that Okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you very much for that time. I really appreciate. Thank
Speaker 2
You very much.'''},

          "Transcript": '''Speaker 1
Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds and how you incorporate cultural considerations into your assessments?
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes, this is actually where the culture comes in. Culturally every culture has precautions toward older people and then some of us have seen diverse different cultures and people from different backgrounds. Now no man on earth likes to fall down. You are the person that will inform some patients ‘please you need to have this or that’. When I tell people ‘you need to have walking stick’, some don’t like it cause they feel like it makes them pitied and it makes them feel old and it is next to death. These are the problems but then you as a therapist takes it to reserve the life of your patient, it’s not the patient. It is you that will inform and prescribe it for the patient. You are the one that will suffer when your patient falls so you incorporate this at the background of the culture, then asking your client or your patient, ‘in your place do you use this or that?’ and then the patient is like ‘no we don’t but then if you feel like it is necessary, I will use it for the mean time, yes it is okay.
Speaker 1
Thank you sir. So sir, how do you ensure that your mobility strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your client? How do you ensure that your mobility plan are culturally sensitive for your patients or clients?
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes so basically, the sensitive cultures like when you come to the Islam and Christianity and then tied which is the most basic ones in Nigeria, traditional religion, personally, like let’s take the Igbo culture, we see that once a man falls down or a woman falls down, you raise the person up. Now the first concept to you is that an older person is not supposed to fall down, especially under your care. This should be the background of your informed concept. Let’s take for the Islam before we come to Christianity. In the Islam they like to sit down, they like to fold their legs most often on the ground. In walking around they usually don’t like holding walking sticks if you check thousands of them. They believe they are in Mecca and you see so many of them walking like that. It is likely that tier religion does not like or support walking aids. What you will do is that you will have to explain based in the ethical background of your profession. You will have to explain clearly what and what the person will achieve in this. He believes Islam does not allow it or support it. I can’t quote any verses or chapter from the Quran but looking at them generally, they don’t. But then in the Christian religion, Abraham, Moses, Jacob, most of them even the younger adults in the scriptures, some of them that are Nomads, they used walking stick to walk around which means that you can lean on it to rest especially those that are going for a longer distance where there is no stick or there is tree to lean on and there is no seat to sit. There is a way they position the walking stick and then they lean on it and have a little rest. So what I will inform is that as a Christian, it is not far fetched from the verse of the Bible that the rod and the scepter of the kingdom will not leave Judah. So which means that under the background of the Christian religion we support taking care of the older adults with every means to preserve their dignity, to preserve their bones and other things so that they don’t fall. 
Speaker 1
Thank you so much sir. Sir, how do you educate your clients about the importance of mobility while respecting their cultural believes. 
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: okay, I will educate them because as a professional the approach to be on the red flag. At a certain age in life, we all started at the cradle. We crawled we stood and we were very energetic and very active. Young adults, we move mountains, we jump. I will show them that when one is at age 50, the system is not longer how it was at age 30. At age 50, the system is telling you that basically you don’t need to actually support yourself without precautions. You just follow precautions to live longer and precautions not to have falls, and the dangers and the complications of fall should be made plain to them because head injury at their age will cause a lot of things, spinal cord injury or dislocation of any joint. It is easy for you to see fall or fracture due to unhealthy movement. Now you have to educate the person that at any given age, mobility is important for the system to live longer, and that the health of each bone depends on the mobility, Bone is built an stress and if the person continues on that stress it will lead to arthritis and all kind of things. And even the death of blood after 120 days, new blood are produced at the bone marrow. The viability of blood depends on the viability of bone and it depends on how viable that bone is. Okay these are the things that help you to do that. 
Speaker 1
Okay thank you sir. Sir, please in your own opinion what cultural factors should be considered when accessing or addressing mobility issues in older adults with different ethnic groups? Which factors do you consider?
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: okay so some factors like , in each culture, there are groups or cultural heritage that people have like the norms of each culture, like in some village settings, you as a therapist, you would have to study them. The factor that will work on these ones. The physical factors, the spiritual factors, you consider the adverse effects of the environmental factors. I think these 3 bases are very important. Under the spiritual factors, some people may wish to leave alone, like the monks that love living alone. Some would say ‘I am on the mountain today, I don’t need to work out, they are facing their spiritual life. So you can’t come in there and tell them to start moving. They have that as a sacrilege so they don’t need to do it otherwise other than what the culture tells them to do. Even the traditional, some people are being doctored. They say that ‘this is what my religion says’. This is the spiritual side of it. Under the physical side or it , the physical factor is like when somebody comes out, like if you check the Hindus religion, there is way they walk into their shrine or something where they serve their own gods and then physically you look at the reverend fathers and you see how they walk to the alter, under that quiet movement. You tell the person to walk to like a rascal, it’s not possible. So you can’t penetrate that, it’s already documented. That physical side of it they must obey it. Like the older people in the village, some of them when they stand up, they start shouting ‘my waist o’ and they hold their waist and hold their knee and walk, and then you know that this is older person. The quality of your movement is determined by the physical factor. When you are rehabilitating patients, you do know that the floor will not be too hard. It will be cushioned should invade the patient falls. 
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from participating in mobility program? 
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes, as I said for example, you see the Pope’s with their long stick. Most of them have it at an elderly age like 80 or 85 years. But if you de some of all these great great monks and the rest, at the age of 60 they are still very young. In your own side and my own side as a physiotherapist, I should consider how to penetrate and be able to work out a modality of inclusion. The inclusive criteria should be informed, it should not be rigid, it’s should be flexible. If it is too rigid without the cultural background of the or other setting, you will end up messing everything up. But when they see that you you’re flexible, it’s is better. You make sure that age plays a factor. I think age should have even come into that of the cultural factors still. These re the things that you consider.
Speaker 1
okay thank you sir. Sir, please how do you engage family members or caregivers in mobility assessments or intervention process when cultural practices are involved? How do you engage them to help you out? 
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes, how you can engage them is still educationally.
Speaker 1
okay thank you. Sir, please how do you stay informed about cultural practices that may incline your clients mobility level? How do you tend to stay informed?
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: A good physiotherapist goes ahead of his patient or client. You read more and you interact with people because you work with different Human faces and different backgrounds. So you should read ahead, interact with people, listen to the news, go back to the history of different cultures and different backgrounds all over the world especially when you are practicing l. Like maybe when you are practicing in the northern side, you go down and you read about their history and their different backgrounds. You also read about their religion. Each community you come into, you check in on the elders, you listen and then you ask questions. You get your informed concept about the do’s and the Don’ts of that community. 
Speaker 1
Sir how do you collaborate with other health care professionals such as the cultural interpreters and other community health workers to ensure that your community intervention are culturally sensitive? 
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes, that is the area that you talk about. Language barriers. You can’t really get everything 100% when it come to language barriers especially if you are not of that origin and what not and you don’t speak their language. Now think of when Christianity penetrated the African culture, they all used interpreters. They don’t hear you but the must have educated somebody that hears their language and who will interpret best the language of the people of that setting who will carry them along. So it is very important when it comes to the concept of language barriers. 
Speaker 1
Thank you sir. Sir please can you share an example of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural considerations and how it impacted the life of your patient? 
Speaker 2
Dr okutu: Yes, the mobility at certain stage has so many things but under the cultural like if you check on the basic of mobility in pediatrics, like in children that cannot move, they have rollers. Those rollers in the village that time, they will bring a wooden stick with something like a slippers tyre. They will open it and they will fix it. It has rollers in the the front, at the back, and the other sides. And then the caregivers or the mother or the parents or the older ones, they will be singing in the front trying to get the attention of the child. He might even try something like biscuits in front or sweets. So this is something that is culturally induced and it helped people those days for children that cannot walk until we left those things. In the olden days we have clutches like a wooden stick. Under mobility, you see they have chairs constructed with wood and they know how they push it like a cart. The cart they used to push elderly people those days are the kings. These are all examples of mobilities. Ideas that we have today came from stages of the olden days. So these are the things that we can see.

Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds and how you incorporate cultural considerations in your mobility assessment 
Speaker 2
This is a hard one actually,But the major thing that i know culturally is we try to maintain a cultural standard that is based on respect and how we treat the elderly.In igbo culture,we believe in respect and how you address an elderly and the title you give to an elderly person;when you see someone that is old enough to be your grandmother, you don't start calling the person by her name, or you  start calling the person Mr or Mrs, you address the person with mama or Papa ,if it a chief,you address the person with chief.I remember a man(he is late) when I was in neurosurgery and tried to assess the man and the we called the man daddy and the man couldn't respond but then I asked the wife, what name do you call this man, that he responds to more? She said his friends call him alahaji and we called him alahaji,this was a man that was almost unconscious,his (.       ) years was about six and all that,but then I called the man alahaji and he responded.So that was what respecting the cultural orientation of the patient is and that is that for .The experience has been very very enlightening and helpful.It is a must for every health worker, it's actually called cultural intelligence; cultural intelligence is when you understand the customs and believe and the lifestyles of this person based on their customs and you relate to them based on how their custom,how they belief life should be because of their customs. It's actually cultural intelligence and it helps a lot in managing patient with us.
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
one of the way is by the (.       ) of the caregiver,when a care giver is around and probably there is mobility you want to do,for instance ; passing mobilization to the lower limb, for a woman there are tendencies that some parts of her body will be exposed,so you ask questions actually,but the little we can do is to use mobile blight as slide to cover the place to ensure that optimum level of privacy is maintained.But another way is to ask questions and my chief will always say back in the day, when you are treating a patient, look at her face and look at the face of the caregiver,if you notice that their are new things you can ask questions and know what,to them you feel you are not doing right,engage them, always engage your patient and their caregivers,if it is something that we cannot deal with you can explain to them and they insist then you have no other choice than to follow their cultural belief and everything.Just like in the case of a patient that had an accident and need a blood transfusion but because they are Jehovah witness patient ,they don't believe in blood transfusion so engaging your patient is a major key, when your patient is insistent on it,you don't any other choice than to stand down in that gravity.
Speaker 1
Can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or interventions plan to accomodate a client belief?
Speaker 2
I have never really encountered so many of this situation. One of them  are situation where a patient was reluctant or less compliant to assessment or intervention because of their cultural beliefs or practices.I think I have encountered but this one is quite fanatical,when I went to go and see a  patient with beauty franka and he was a Jehovah witness and the man was trying to win beauty franka over and beauty franka was just ignoring him and still doing what he was doing and we go to see the man three times in a week.So after beauty franka was made a Reverend,the man now said  he someone they're trying to save from hell and the person has joined hell full-time ,he told beauty franka he doesn't want to be seeing beauty franka again and this is a form of cultural issue although it is more religious than cultural,so there is a connection between religion and culture and where the man came from and so that was how we stopped seeing the man.This is basically the only one I can remember, where culture was a major hinderance ,and that was how we stopped seeing the man again.
Speaker 1
How do you educate your clients about the importance of mobility while respecting thier cultural beliefs?
Speaker 2
Anyways cultural intelligence is important because it can help you speak the language of your client,it might not be literally one language but it can help you speak the language of your client.You can educate them,let them know,if a patient gets communication it is very important. Let them know what they are going through,let them know the pathophysiology of their condition,let them know how that thing is affecting them,then let them see what they can gain.Everybody will listen when they realize what they can gain regardless of culture,they are in a condition where they don't want to be,that is a major key point,a major strong hold, you're in a condition that you don't want to be.Paint the picture of who they use to be, paint the picture of what they can be. Regardless of culture,the Muslim wants to walk,a Christian wants to walk, a traditionalist wants to use their legs, regardless of your religion and culture in the hospital,you want to lead your hospital, you don't want to die.As much as culture shouldn't mix up with professional practice, cultural understanding, cultural intelligence is an advantage in professional practice,so you can use your cultural practice to navigate through their cultural ignorance. Let them know what they stand to benefit from it, their condition alone is enough reality to them so let them know what they stand to gain,anybody will always key in when they find out they have something to gain and that is just how it is.
Speaker 1
In your opinion what cultural factors should be considered when assessing or addressing mobility issues in older adults from different ethnic or cultural groups?
Speaker 2
To me, the cultural factors that should be considered includes ,Respect:If a patient is old,if he/she is at a particular age grade, I think understanding age grade is a major factor when you want to assess or treat an older patient , address them based on their age grade and if they're titled, address them by their title,if he is chief, address him as a chief.I remember a woman I was treating,the woman is a professor,even though she is old,i address her as mama or mummy this is respect and culture. In culture, respect is a major things especially when you're dealing with an older patient,you interact with them,and communication is about 7 %verbal ,non verbal communication is about fifty something percent tone of voice is about 37%,body language of also about fifty something percent .A professional that understand the parameters of communication will find it easier to incorporate cultural intelligence in their profession, everything is communication regardless of the administration you want to give.So when you call a patient mummy,is your body language showing you actually see the person as mummy or daddy or mama or Papa,is your non verbal communication showing that,is the tone of your voice showing that?
Yes,it can be incorporated when you're dealing with older people,you should respect them starting from how you address them,you come there,you greet them,older people always responds to respect once you respect them,and it makes them relax and see you as their child,this is an added advantage, compliance will increase,even when you're managing them and they are feeling pain, your approach alone has calm them down.
But that is not to say that you now allow for familiarity, because it's a  major stumbling block in professional practice that is not to say you allow familiarity and see finish,but you have to create that environment for them to relax and respond to your treatment.Beyond the physical health thing there is also the psychological and emotional side of the treatment.When you do this,you create that which is more powerful, psychological and emotional side if the treaty is even more powerful than the physical thing you're doing.You create that emotional environment for them to respond to your treatment in the way they should.So that is what it should be , respect them, acknowledge their title, acknowledge their age,that is what it should be.
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from accessing or participating in mobility programs or interventions?
Speaker 2
educate the.something I do sometimes when I approach a patient and the patient is not being so complaint,I get a chair and get it close to them and sit down,I don't stand up to address them,if I stand up to address them i be like just a doctor,a time has to be when you just have to drop that thing and just relate with your client.I met a woman,the woman was not complaint,I brought a chair and told her mummy,"what is going on", "who is finding your trouble? 
Cracked jokes,did all that just to calm her down then we began to talk.Educate them,make them see like I said before in no.2 what they stand to gain, hear their terms and conditions, know which if the terms and conditions is detrimental to them or beneficial to them,and let them know together with their caregivers.
I think education is important in this part, educate them,let them know what they stand to gain and what they stand to lose and how what's need to be done is going to affect them but then the choice is still theirs,if they continue to be less complaint or choose not to,you cannot do anything. In most cases, educating then helps,once that ignorance is dealt with especially when they are old,one if the problem of old people is prejudice,they feel this thing is like this and should always be like that,they don't always believe in changing times,they don't always believe in change.
So when you can help them see you're advantaged and realize that this person actually want to help them and you educate them, it's always difficult for those of them that are not educated or enlightened, it's always easier for those that are learned and have gone to school or who their caregivers went to school and are educated or enlightened,but for the case if those that are not educated or enlightened if you can make them understand, especially their caregivers around, their caregivers can now tell you do this thing for our mummy,I want her to be well regardless of what she say.So once their caregivers gives that consent,you can actually bypass the patient or your client but then it is always good to educate your patient,let her know what she stands to gain and what she stands to lose if she continues to allow her cultural belief remain a barrier to what you want to do.
Just like I said in no.6, engage the caregiver,if a patient is not compliant based on cultural beliefs.
They caregivers that is there,especially when they're a relative.
No.1 they're the ones that are spending the money.
2:they don't want their relative to die
3: They're showing care,but they have better things they can do with their time.
You can call the caregiver out and explain, educate them too,most times the patient doesn't want to die,the patient wants to walk and be fully functional again.
If the patient is not compliant,you can take the caregiver out and explain to the caregiver.
I did that to a woman that had spinal injury,the woman wasn't so compliant,I called the son out and I spoke to the boy ,I told him what to do and by the time I came back the woman was happy again.
Speaker 1
How do you engage family members or caregivers in the mobility assessment or interventions process particularly when cultural beliefs are involved?
Speaker 2
Sometimes you have to educate the caregiver, tell the caregiver look at what will happen, make them know you understand them but don't impose reasons on them.Every human being has a mind and can reason,make them see reasons,if they're enlightened it's always easier. If they are not enlightened it's also an advantage because you can use big grammers to solve your problems.
Speak to them,let them understand, educate them and I think that solves the problem.
Speaker 1
Can you share an example of of a successful mobility intervention that incorporated cultural considerations and how it impacted the clients health or quality of life?
Speaker 2
Like I said ,The one I have is that woman I was treating. It’s not really a cultural issue but the woman was not responding. She wasn’t eating. She was taking only pap. She wasn’t smiling. She was all down. So I came and spoke to her and told her see see see look at what your not eating is doing to you and by the time I came the next day,the woman was happy. I think some of you even saw her. She was happy, joyful. I told the son to download films for her. The woman was watching and was laughing and all that. So I’ve not really had any serious issue like this oh. I can’t remember any but with this little experience I had although it’s not cultural,I believe you will have an idea of what it will be like.
Speaker 1
How do you stay informed about cultural practices and beliefs that may impact your client's mobility level?
Speaker 2
education and experience. Education,enlightenment Studying, reading articles and experiments. Not just your experience but other people’s experiences. Like the experience I had years back. That was a wonderful experience. I realized how culture can actually you know. The funny thing about it is that the man didn’t chase us away. The man had  epilesia from stroke. He could barely move his I think his left or right. By the time we finished the man could walk,the man could write and the man could talk. The funny thing is that it was after we had been able to get this man’s toes that the man now chased us away. I don’t know whether he would have told us to leave if he couldn’t stand up. But that was a very wonderful experience and cultural beliefs and practices can actually play the major role in patients compliance and health professionals intervention and assessment can play a very major roles. Yeah enlightenment, reading are the basic knowledge in that aspect and experience especially in rural areas will actually be a major way to get better informed in the practice.
Speaker 1
How do you collaborate with other health care professionals such as cultural interpreters or community health workers to ensure that your mobility intervention are culturally sensitive and appropriate
Speaker 2
we know that in health team, one of the components of a health team is the clergy. The clergy might be an Imam,pastor, a priest or a traditionalist . The person is part of the health team.  I think I have told you guys this when you guys were still in neuro surgery units so it will help in information on the things you need to know. The cultural barriers or the cultural advantages that you have in seeing that patients you know. They will let you know what their beliefs are. They will keep you informed and with that information, you can know how to navigate your way and attend to the patient. Because in the long run, what they might say is just an enlightenment. You will now know ok this patient…you will even know ok in this peoples place male physiotherapist don’t see females in their place before Amadioha will strike you. It will now let you know what you should do to give this patient what they need so that’s just it. They play an informatry role in helping you treat this patient and do what you should do for them so that’s just it.'''},

Can you describe your experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds and how you incorporate cultural considerations into your mobility assessments?
Speaker 2
Most of my years of practice, I practiced mostly in Abuja, I schooled in Ghana, I think from my undergraduate degrees and my Masters in the UK and most of my practice from internship to working have majorly been in Abuja and one thing I can assure you is that in Abuja, they have a higher population of Northerners and a lot of times I have seen a lot of cases where you have a lot of people especially the females and you see some men who are not comfortable with exposing their selves to the female practitioners 
Most times when I meet patients and after introducing myself to them, depending on how I see the patient, I ask and I will be like before I start something, I am going to expose some parts of your body or if am going to........ it, I ask the patient. Thats something I do for all my patients, I will ask and be like "I am about to do this, is it okey if I do it" and then I get response from them, some of them are like YES, some of them may not be comfortable with certain things i want to do and so I will take that into consideration in managing the patient, because you cannot do something that is against the will of the patient, so there are times whereby maybe I am setting the .........., I would want to pull down the persons short a bit to be able to examine properly, I will explain that to the patient, "this is what I want to do", if incase it is okay for you.  
Speaker 1
can you give an example of how you have modified your mobility assessment or intervention plan to accomodatea clients cultural beliefs or practice?
Speaker 2
I have had cases where some patient will be like NO, I don't want you to do that because you are a female and in that case, I would ask what woyld you rather have, do you want someone else to do the assessment, now someone else sometimes many not be someone as experienced as I am l, and may be at that point in time I may notvhave a male colleague, it may be an intern,  but if the person opt for maybe a male and the person available is an intern, I will definitely give him the intern and most likely after the intern is through, we will discuss about the patient and his findings, and sometimes because of the whole issue of man power, I may not have a male colleague in my unit at that point in time that is available to do the assessment, so in that case, that will obviously absess the treatment of the patient because I am more experienced, I can do the whole assessment for you, if I give an intern to do the assessment, if he does it, it will be based on what he comes to tell via his findings, then I will advice and say okay, you should probably do this or that, but it won't be the same if am the one carrying out tge assessment and then I make my findings on my own. For me its mainly about informed consent, I will get consent from the patient, explaining to them, what I am about to do by asking if they are okay with it, because like I sai, I was in the North, I had those, like some men who will outrightly tell you, I don't want a female to see me or touch me and in that case, there is mothing you can do about it, so that's how I take culture into......... But most times, you find some of them who don't  have an issue with a female attending to them. 
The first thing to do especially when assessing the older adults is to know the role of that person in the society, at home irrespective of the individual, like what kind of chores does the person perform at home. 
Speaker 1
How do you address cultural barriers that may prevent clients from accessing or participating in mobility programs or interventions? 
Speaker 2
Definitely I have had those patients especially when during my training in Ghana, but often here in Nigeria I have had that kind of barrier. 
Yes, I have those issues, you will have people that will come and one of the good things I have encountered is that am in the North, Abuja is mainly filled with a lot of Northerners and a lot of them speak Hausa, I also speak Hausa and some speaks Pidigin English but they have been cases where I meet people who can't speak Hausa even though they are from the North, they probably speak their Indigenous language and in that case, communication now becomes a huge barrier and then asides that, for elderly patients some of them as they age, they are understanding the compromise, so in those cases I have had issues, most times when that happens I can't see a patient that I cannot communication with, so sometimes I ask for another patient or care giver who is present and can interprete and also try to just help me understand the person and for the person to understand what am saying, the issue with that is that communication gets missing in terms of when saying something to someone and the person is interpreting it, so a lot of times when I have this type of patients, especially maybe if you want them to do or perform a particular task or maybe walking......... it takes extra effort, a lot of hard work because its not like a regular patient that you will just easily say okay, I need you to do this and the patient will understand you especially with older adults as I said, a lot of them they are understanding the compromise that they are not quick or maybe cannot understand what you are saying, some of them have all sort of issues that could affect the way they comprehend you, so that definitely can be quite a huge challenges and sometimes it can be quit frustrating. I have had cases of maybe when you go to the ward, you are trying to teach and elderly person how to use the............. and you are trying to explain that they should not lay on that.......... or maybe partial weak bearing and then it becomes very difficult to communicate what exactly you want, so those are issues I regularly face especially in elderly patients. 
Speaker 1
How do you ensure that your mobility enhancement strategies are culturally sensitive and appropriate for your clients?
Speaker 2
I have had people dress in certain ways especially the elderly who like to wear a long....... In terms of dressing like in the North, a lot of them like wearing a long clothig materials and most times it's because the elderly, if like a female comes and you are trying to call out patient reading and you are trying to ambulate the patient with Zimmer frame of......... Maybe with a stick and then you see that what the patient is wearing will not permit the patient to do what you want, most times what I do is, I educate the patient and explain to them, this is what I want the patient to do, like saying "this Jalabia you are wearing is long" or sometimes it may even be the.......... they have gone the out patient department and they are trying to do probably non-weak bearing, partial weak bearing and they are wearing this long overall that you cannot even see what exactly they are doing, if they are doing partial...... In such cases I would educate the patient if they understand or the patient relative thats if the patient do not understand and tell them "this is what I want this patient to do", now this patient will be unable to do this and sometimes it could be as simple as being on the bicycle ergometer, if you are wearing a long free gown as a woman, it may be difficult for you to achieve because you are dealing with a lot at the same time. So most times I will let the patient know about the attire which will not allow me to administer treatment properly, so I would need you to wear something differently. And most times, the patient understands because they know that if you are trying to do such working and they are wearing a long flay gowns, the long flay gown can make them fall down, a patient that yoh are trying to teach how to walk with a Zimmer frame, its only cokmon sense if they are walking with a zimmer frame, its possible that the long gown would intertwine with the zimmer frame and at the end they may fall down and that is one thing that we don't want, because we wouldn't want our patient to fall down especially when they had a hip displacement surgery, so most times I explain that to the patient and a lot of times, they are very understanding and they will now be thinking, whats the appropriate thing that I need to put on, then you may suggest wearing a leggings under or a long 3 quarter outfit, so a lot of times, these patients are willing to make those changes, I don't think that in my years of practice that I have met anyone and tell them that what ever they are wearing will affect their treatment and they will reply with a NO, that they won't do it, because most a times when someone is sick, at that point in time what they want is to recover, so even tho, I understand that there are cultural limitations to it, Ibhave had femaleswho come in and I will be telling them, I need you to expose yourself because I want to carry out this movement and they are may not be comfortable with it but what I do is to just make sure I properly screen the place, I get and extra oil and a piece of covering to cover them up, because you can not be treating a woman and everywhere is just exposed, so sometimes, I put an extra screen, lock the door and administer the treatment, if I can. These are things I put into considerations, because if you don't do that, the patient is not going to cooperate with me. Because if you have a friend you cannot ask her to wear shorts and come to....... A woman that have never exposed her leg in her life, you are not going to get that. Most a times we just try to see how to balance while still respecting the culture of these patients and at the same time trying to do something that works well, so you don't suggest they do something that is out of their comfort zone. 
Speaker 1
How do you stay informed about cultural practices and beliefs that may impact your clients' mobility levels?
Speaker 2
Culture differs and some certain things that a Yoruba person will be okay with, someone that is Hausa may not be okay with it and someone that is Igbo is okay with something, someone who is Yoruba or Hausa might not be okay with it. So personally, what I do is that I usually communicate to my patient, like I have always said, I would explain to them,  this is what I want to do, is it okay with you, and if they give a go ahead, the fine I go ahead with it, it may be quite difficult to understand every single cultural practice in a particular culture, but then am willing to always understand the patient, not like when I want to do something, I will jump and say to the patient, "lets start doing this", I usually explain, this is what I want you to do, this is what it entails, is it okay with you, if they say YES, I proceed, but if they say its not okay with them maybe culturally, am always open to learning then, I will say okay good, I now understand.  Sometimes even my interactions with my colleagues from certain phases, I learn about what is obtainable and not obtainable from different culture, so most times, it might be quite difficult to know everything that is going on in an ethnic group in Nigeria but then at least from my experiences with patients, it took my experiences from one person from the North, this is the culture that is obtained in this place, so when I see someone else narrating the same thing or having the same expectation with that person, it is easier for you to know that okay this is something that is obtainable in this culture, so maybe I met someone who is Yoruba and the person tells me culturally this is what is obtained, that is a learning point for me, so I may go to one of my colleague or someone from Yoruba and ask him/he, is this what is obtained in your culture and they say YES this is what then that reforms my decision, so the next time I see  a Yoruba person and I want to do something similar and I ask, is it okay and the person says NO, its not okay, then am not surprised, so most of my learning are from the patient themselves and from colleagues or from people I interact with by asking them whats obtained in your culture, is this okay or is this not okay, so it won't seem surprisingly to me when a patient comes and presents with something and says this is what I believe and this is what I don't believe in. 
Speaker 1
How do you collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as cultural interpreters or community health workers, to ensure that your mobility interventions are culturally sensitive and appropriate?
Speaker 2
For me, it is more of communication, being open to learning and being also able to understand that there are different dynamics, so the collaboration, there are times whereby they are certain things to know, that the doctor who is referring a patient would come and discuss with you as a therapist and say this is it, and if for instance in your own firm, when trying to do something and you find out that there are certain cultural barriers with certain cultural hinderances, something I do have issues, I won't hesitate to meet the other members of the........ And discuss with them and say this is the issue, this is the challenges am facing, there are times I go to the ward to see patient and I kight be faced with the issues of language barriers, issues qith maybe what the patient have heard, there are times I go to the ward, I see a male and the his like, is there no male therapist that can attend to me because am not comfortable with a female attending to me, what I do is to communicate with the nurses on duty, I document it in the patients folder so that it will be noted there and then its just a way of collaborating with them apart from that, I discuss ways in which we have to work out via the patients problem. 
As for me, it is just all abou communicating with other members of the health care to ensure that we are able to find a.................... '''}

      "- This project is a qualitative thematic analysis of interviews with several physiotherapists\n",
      "- This thematic analysis will involve first identifying codes across multiple transcripts, grouping similar codes into categories, and finally grouping one or more categories into themes to ultimately answer the research question.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Below is information about the transcripts that are the center of analysis in this project \n",
      "- Transcripts consist of interviews between 2 people:\n",
      "    - The interviewer is a researcher\n",
      "    - The interviewee is an experienced physiotherapist\n",
      "- Transcripts contain errors\n",
      "    - In the transcription of the interview's audio recording\n",
      "    - In the labelling of the speakers\n",
      "    - There should be enough contextual clues in the transcript to allow you to ignore these errors\n",

      "1. **Transcript**: The entire conversation, identified by a unique Transcript ID (e.g., \"A\" for transcript 'A').\n",
      "2. **Speech Turn**: A segment where a single speaker talks continuously, identified by a unique Speech Turn ID (e.g., \"A.1.2\" for speech turn 1 of transcript 'A' which is spoken by speaker 2).\n",
      "3. **Sentence**: Individual sentences within a Speech Turn, identified by a unique Sentence ID (e.g., \"A.1.2.0\" for the first sentence of speech turn 1 spoken by speaker 2 in transcript 'A').\n",

      "## IDs Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Transcript ID**: At the start of every ID; identifies the transcript from which the content originates (e.g., \"A\").\n",
      "- **Speech Turn ID**: Combines Transcript ID, turn number, and speaker number (e.g., \"A.1.2\").\n",

      "A.17.2.8: Okay.\n",

      "A.20.2.5: And then she had a lot of issues.\n",

      "A.20.2.7: Okay.\n",
      "A.20.2.8: Another thing was that while she was on, even on the ward, she was secluded from everybody and the same is what goes on in the house.\n",
      "A.20.2.9: So we had to ensure that she understood the importance of mobility and that she had people around her who could assist her to ensure that she was still active within us because she wasn't really going out again at that time.\n",

      "A.23.2.2: Yeah.\n",
      "A.23.2.3: So we always start our education by letting them know the importance of function.\n",
      "A.23.2.4: Um, looking at definition of aging, you know, aging is a decline of function function, but this decline can be slowed down by ensuring that we optimize the function of the older persons.\n",
      "A.23.2.5: And so the important thing is to educate the family.\n",
      "A.23.2.6: When they understand the role of function and the health of their person.\n",
      "A.23.2.7: Yes.\n",
      "A.23.2.8: They generally just come around and they able to help them achieve that function.\n",
      "A.23.2.9: So if for example, we've seen patients who this is very common where they feed them.\n",
      "A.23.2.10: Yeah.\n",
      "A.23.2.11: And you know, the more you feed them one of the basic activities that they do for themselves, A D L is feeding.\n",
      "A.23.2.12: Yes.\n",
      "A.23.2.13: And so if you're not going to grade their A D L and they're not feeding themselves, they'll score low on the functional score.\n",
      "A.23.2.14: So once you educate the family and they now on understand it, you'll see a huge improvements in their ability to perform their Ts.\n",

      "1. **Transcript**: The entire conversation, identified by a unique Transcript ID (e.g., \"A\" for transcript 'A').\n",
      "2. **Speech Turn**: A segment where a single speaker talks continuously, identified by a unique Speech Turn ID (e.g., \"A.1.2\" for speech turn 1 of transcript 'A' which is spoken by speaker 2).\n",
      "3. **Sentence**: Individual sentences within a Speech Turn, identified by a unique Sentence ID (e.g., \"A.1.2.0\" for the first sentence of speech turn 1 spoken by speaker 2 in transcript 'A').\n",
